CHAPTER ONE
Taiyo stood in the shadows by the window, her
back to the room. From her vantage position o the third
floor of the building where their flat was located, she had
bird's eye view of the sprawling town__
The rising sun
shone on rooftops, giving them a yellowish tinge
Across
the roads that crisscrossed the town, diminutive figures
of men and
women   hurried briskly
to their places   of

down at the
courtyard,
she could see her father moving ad fussing
He was organizing and directing; with obvious shortness
of temper; the loading of two ten-ton  lorries  He
was
gesticulating violently, apparently reprimanding loaders

them:

and
were

forced
to
vacate the house and relocate to the rural town he had
left many years back. Although the distance would not
allow her to hear what he was telling the loaders, Taiyo
felt a mild but
genuine twinge of sympathy for the
poor fellows down there, for she knew the
of her
father's tongue.
It reminded her of her own recent battle with him
when he denied her permission
to travel to
Mombasa

other
young
men

extravaganza:
She
had
stubbornly   put
up
spirited
struggle but the battle was so predictably and utterly lost.
That had left a wound in her heart that was still too raw
to probe. Her rage, she realised
was still
seething within
her.
The   simple faith and certainty of childhood upon
which her life until then had been found, had failed her_
Also, her trust that her father would give her whatever
she requested
had been badly shaken:
Stemming those thoughts
of her mind,
she
raised
her head  andlooked
through
the   morning

beams
that
gleamed
brightly
across
the   rooftops
of
Nakuru town; that beloved town that was the mother of
all
flamingos.
town that she was now about to leave_
Tears
welled
in her eyes.
She   blinked   suddenly
and
rapidly.
Taiyo

sister   Resian
approach:
Briefly   and
in   silence,
stood
by
the
window side by side in the empty room
As far back as
the two sisters could remember;
had always stood
by that window every Sunday morning before they went
to church:
But their little habit of observing what went
on below the streets of the town was made poignant that
morning; it was going to be the last time
would do
this_
Resian leaned forward and lifted her face to look
into her sister's
brown eyes. She spoke
but her words  were distinct and her voice very clear in
the silent empty room:
"Taiyo- e
yeiyo, what do you think life is going
to be like in Nasila?"
"For heaven's   sake, Resian
Taiyo said, turning
round to face her sister: "How am I supposed to know?"

"We have always known that it was our father's
plan to end up in Nasila;
Taiyo told her sister; trying
hard not to answer her directly,
That is why he built that
shop that he has always spoken about Now that he has
been

she
hesitated
moment_
It
transpired that the more she spoke of the relocation, the
harder the reality that she
was  about to leave Nakuru
town for good hit her:
The twenty years of her life had
been   spent   there.
She   loved
its
crowded   streets,
the
bustle and excitement of its wholesale and retail markets,
and the boisterous bus  stage_
But  the
most painful to
leave behind was her boyfriend Lenjirr; the lanky dark-
haired,
blunt-faced young man
whose big languid eyes
had always smiled at her warmly, fostering in her the
dreams of young womanhood
"Taiyo-e-yeiyo?" Resian called,

to look up suspiciously into the face of her tall sister: "Is
something amiss?"
"No, nothing is amiss_

worried,
dear
sister.
Resian's
voice dropped
little with apprehension: "What do you
think will
happen to us if the shop father intends to open
does not become as successful as he hopes?"
'Resian-e-yeiyo, I don't know any better than you!
Father thinks the shop will be a success. I overheard him
tell
one
of his
friends
that
he
was
going
to
stock
agricultural inputs such as fertilizer; seeds, animal

and

declared_

and
her
voice
sounding petulant:

join Egerton  University.

You aren't laughing;
are you? I mean it.
'Im

little
sister;
Taiyo
said
fervently;
'you know too well that it is also my ardent
ambition to join the university
How nice it would be if
father were to allow the two of us to join:
I would love
it!" "It would be wonderful,
Resian said excitedly, the
elation evident
in her  voice. "You  will then  persuade
father to allow us to come back to Nakuru and join the
university, won't you;, Taiyo-e-yeiyo?"
'I can't promise that with certainty;'
Taiyo said
and tore her look away from her sister's face. "You know
the stubborn nature of father.
She looked down into the
courtyard where their father was still
moving from
one
to
the other; making sure that their furniture
was loaded as
fittingly as possible so that it did not break
on the
way.
When   she heard   him
at
one
of the
workers,
cold knot of anger and resentment tightened
in the pit of her stomach, a flash of almost physical pain:
She wondered what made her sister think she would be
able to persuade their father to allow them come back to
Nakuru
and join  the  university
if

Once more, she recalled with bitterness how
her father's refusal to allow her to go to Mombasa and
participate
in
the
musical   extravaganza
had
nearly
damaged the father-daughter relationship that had always
been remarkably close.
"Please try
to talk to him; wont you;

"He always listens

and

Just

"Ill try;"
Taiyo
said   doubtfully
to
close  the
delicate
subject.
Behind them and from the adjacent room 
their
mother's voice rose, the edge of complaint in it making
them take keener interest o what was happening down
there at the courtyard.
At that very moment, their father
craned his neck and looked up, as if to see
what
were
doing at the window.
"Taiyo, what o the earth are you
there at
the window instead of helping me pack?" their mother
asked

That  short speech poignantly brought reality to

his
throat   loudly.
His
wife,
Mama Milanoi, took
handkerchief from her pocket
and blew her nose.
The four of them stood there for
moment in
a sudden silence, each oe of them keeping
their thought to themselves. But one
that was clear
to all of them was that the flat that had been their home
for
SO
many
years,   stripped
of
all   furniture,
of
all
personal possessions, all books, pictures and ornaments,
now looked bleak and shabby.

preceded their daughters out of that flat:
was the
last to leave: She turned at the doorway, stood for a
moment
looking back into the room that she had seen all
of her childhood.
Then,  with
tears
in her eyes, firmly
closed the door and followed the others down the stairs_
Minutes later; when all of them
were settled in
the fourteen-seater minibus that Ole Kaelo had hired for
them, the journey began in
earnest.
Father and mother
sat in the front seat while the
shared the back seat

the bigger picture of their relocation   When her husband
broke
the news that he had
been  retrenched,
she
was
dumbfounded. It was as though
thunderbolt had struck
her out of a midday blue sky. Ever since she got married
to Ole Kaelo twenty-two years earlier; Agribix Limited
had been her husband's employer and the sole source of
her familys livelihood
Now that it was

an
inevitability that

always   coming:

the
he
was
engaged and now, like
baby who must be born at the
fullness of time, this had come to pass_
He counseled and
convinced her that she had nothing to fear for he had
prepared for that eventuality. He was of the opinion that
could go back home and start afresh; embrace the
life of their community.
Once   she
was   convinced that relocation
would
enable   them begin
new
phase of life,
she
became
unflaggingly enthusiastic.
She began to see in her mind
how a brand new house and
a well-stocked shop that her
husband promised to set up o the right side of Nasila
town; predictably offered  glamour and
a chance to
be
associated with the great and the powerful of the land.
She
saw
chance
for  her  family
to
share
the
fortune
enjoyed by those
who
were
already
happily
settled in
the rural town.
But above all,
she thought, it
would be easier to marry off her two girls in the new
town   than
in
the  melting pot
that
Nakuru
town
had
become. Yes, two sons-in-law from reputable families in
the land could easily catapult them right into the centre

of the affairs of the community. That could be the re-
into
the   community
that   they
had
been
thinking about, she thought contentedly:
There
was, however;
a   dark spot in the whole
affair:
Women friends from Nasila
who had visited her
in
the   past
had
asked
her
very
intrusive   questions
regarding her daughters_
At that time she dismissed them
as busybodies
who enjoyed intrusion into other people's
affairs. But it now dawned on her that those could be the
mothers of her would be sons-in-law.
The   words they
used to describe the status of her daughters came back to
haunt her like demented spirits of a past that was better
forgotten; Intoiye Nemengalana
had
called
them
contemptuously.
On
his   part;
Parsimei
Ole   Kaelo
sat
quietly
beside his wife, his mind roaming the distant past
in
reminiscence. He knew that he had worked his fingers to
the bone over the years, preparing for that
when he
was no
longer going to be employed. He was o his way
to opening up his business. Not that he felt any particular
excitement
or
pleasure;
he
was
man
to
whom
disappointment
came
more
easily
and  naturally
than
contentment.
And that latter attribute fired his ambition
to always strive for the stars_
It was characteristic of him
that;
surrounded
by
what
other
men
would
have
considered evidence of a well-earned successful life, he
felt nothing but the need to strive even harder to achieve
better results_
He
had

that
seemed
to
question
every   aspect
of
his
life.

But even more obnoxious was the fact that
despite all his achievements, it seemed to him that his
younger brother; Simiren, who remained in Nasila; had
been more appreciated and was considered the cultural
head of the Kaelos by the community. That hurt him_
But
it did not worry him. Since childhood he had been aware,
without self-pity, that no one really liked him. That; too
did not bother him since in his mind,
to pursue the easy
and

of
others
was
sign
of
weakness of character.
Nature
had
not;
however;
been
totally
inconsiderate. It rewarded him with a gem in the form of
his wife-Jane Milanoi_
When he first saw her at a church
service at Nasila, he was stunned.
She was then hardly
eighteen.

And the

fitted   well her tall
shapely figure. From
the

For the
years 0r s0 that Parsimei Ole Kaelo
was away in Nakuru, his younger brother Simiren acted
as the head of the Kaelo family. He ably represented the
family
in the Ilmolelian clan
to
which
belonged.
When there were intalengo to be performed, such as the
initiation of girls, the circumcision of boys o betrothal
ceremonies, he was always there representing his elder
brother and his clan: And he was a strict adherent to his

people's customs and traditions, for which reason he was
respected and appreciated by the elders. There had never
been
any   argument
or
rivalry
between
him
and
his
brother:
Ever   since
were young; and as
grew
up,
Simiren
had   always   accepted
his   position
to
be
subordinate to his elder brother: The fact that he had four
wives and sixteen children
while his brother had only
one
and   two  children,  did not  make
any  difference.

was still the olmorijoi and he still

From

She could also hear the

homestead. But what captivated her most was the cool
natural environment that was created by giant trees that
grew between the houses _
Wondering what could have entranced

air   with
their

air

constant  motion and
cheerful calls_
"Hope our home will look like this,"
said Resian
with enthusiasm:
"It's so calm and peaceful here. It's the kind of home one
would look forward to come back to at the end of the

them to the next house to join the rest of the family for
morning tea:
The three crossed the courtyard talking happily,
the  girls   walking   closely   behind

Like the

shutters for windows and were roofed with

The

became

appropriately, and make it run parallel to the old Nasila

culture. Female circumcision; he said, was not only
an
honoured rite of passage that had been in existence from
time immemorial_
but an important practice that tamed
an otherwise wild
gender. Like cattle that required to be
dehorned,
to reduce accidental injuries to each other;

docility was also necessary to keep
more than one wife in one homestead.
And
Ole Kaelo

lifted and dissipated.
An
atmosphere of excitement ad
anticipation   pervaded
their   hearts _
Their   faces
were
radiant
Their
feet
quickened
as
they
walked
the
remaining distance with bated breath.
Mama Milanoi was also
happy: Although she had
not
seen
the
house
before
then;
she
knew
it
was
tastefully built. She had always trusted her husband to do
the best for the family. There was no reason, therefore,
for her to have doubted him. She married him twenty-
two years ago, not oly to meet the expectations of the
Nasila people, but also to get someone to look after her
and her children:
And
true
to
her   expectation;
Ole
Kaelo
had
always been responsible. Even as she sat happily beside
him
that
sunny
afternoon;
she
let
her
mind
travel
fancifully into her past. She recalled with amusement the
of her father and mother when the parents of one
Parsimei Ole Kaelo, accompanied by other elders came
to their home to engage her:
Her parents  were all

After
what appeared to her to be protracted negotiations, the
parties agreed and she was betrothed.
She
accepted
him
without
any
resistance
Tradition did not allow her to offer any and as expected
of her; she did not resist. So at eighteen; after undergoing
the
mandatory
initiation
rituals,
she
had
married
Parsimei Ole Kaelo who was then twenty-four years old.
And although over the years he had scolded and bullied
her; like
a half-witted   child,
she knew he
was

a man

She also
knew that he loved her genuinely. For
even
after all those years of marriage he still pampered her:
She loved him too and had
childlike dependence on
him. She, however; knew that she had failed miserably
by not giving him the sons that he had so much looked
forward to.
But she also knew it was  still not too late_

their contents onto the floor and sorted them.

Resian said defiantly. "A little noise is not all that bad.

'Do you prefer the Nakuru

"No, not at all_

Resian's   dependence
on

And Taiyo would have been  irked
by her sister's ever present nagging complaints had she
not

aware
of
her
never

unhappiness.
Although
Resian
had

to
complain

grumble
about
life
in

environment;
Taiyo
found it tolerable.
For instance,
she gladly discovered
that  momings at their new home began  with
lively
chatter of birds in the trees surrounding their house. That
gave the home an
atmosphere of tranquility and peace
However, one of the unpleasant aspects that the girls had
to live with was the constant violation of their privacy_

CHAPTER FOUR
Parsimei
Ole
Kaelo
planned
his
homecoming
ceremony meticulously. He had wanted the occasion to
be remarkably memorable, preferably
the form of
the traditional   enkang-o-ntalengo_
He, however;
knew
that having been away from Nasila for many years, he
had lost touch with the cultural sensibilities of the people.
To re-establish the severed links, he enlisted the
help of his brother Simiren and several senior elders of
the
community who were the custodians of his people's
culture_
He was prepared to get down to the bedrock and
find
at which point he lost the way:
He had known
that   odomongi
and   orok-kiteng,
the
legendary
twin
homesteads of the founder that begot the five clans of
Nasila:
Ilmolelian;
Ilmakesen;
Ilukumae,
Ilaiser
and
Iltarrosero, were the cradle of the Nasila people.
He not only desired to reunite with Nasila people
but
also
needed
their   blessings.
He
had,
therefore,
dispatched
people
to
all
corners
of  Nasila
to
invite
representatives of all the five clans to the
party,
which was going to be his re-entry
into the cultural
life of his people.
When he gave thought to the clans, Ole Kaelo
could not help but laugh silently when he recalled the
stereotyped anecdotes that used to be told when he was
young
were   made
up by rival
groups   with
the
intention of lowering the esteem of their adversaries
He
recalled with amusement that his own clan of Ilmolelian
was said to be made up of ludicrously generous men who

would then happily and ridiculously raise up their arms
to show to all and sundry that
had not hidden any

was exactly the opposite. The clansmen were said to be

miserly

the
afterbirth of a she-goat: It was said that

Interestingly,
Ole
Kaelo
was
member
of
the
supposedly
generous
Ilmolelian
clan;
and
his
wife
Milanoi
was the daughter of the close-fisted Ilmakesen
clan_
When
the
party
was
finally
thrown;
it
was
nothing short of ostentatious
And true to the Ilmolelian
spirit and tradition 
Ole Kaelo held nothing back
He
slaughtered

the
living room stood four
tables spread with the
most
astounding
array
of  food

ever
seen_
There were large trays laden with huge chunks of boiled
meat  whose   tantalizing
aroma   filled the

Then there
were
other
choice pieces of meat on skewers and others wrapped up
in sacred oloirien leaves that  were the preserve of the
elders who were to bless the home of intalengo.
It was
only after such blessings that Nasila would receive back

who had
gone
out to hunt
fortunes   and
returned safely.
The  elders  would also bless the wife

That
had began early for Ole Kaelo.
He had
left his bed at cock crow, the time that was known in
Nasila as tolakira-lole-Kasaale. He was to see to it that
every detail about the impending homecoming ceremony
was
taken

of   without

and
absolutely
nothing was to be left to chance. There was little for him
to
do
that   morning
though,
for
all   preparations
and
arrangements had earlier been made, systems had been
set, and all that was left to be done was to implement
what had been
upon_
Days earlier; with the
of his brother Simiren
and his wives, he had gathered
a retinue of young men
and women from his Ilmolelian clan and charged them
with the  responsibility of organising the activities and
chores of the ceremonial
And true to their calling;
the young men and
women  immediately swung  into
variety of activities with zest. Those who belonged to the
sub-clan   of Iloorasha-kineji; to which Ole
Kaelo also
belonged, felt that the responsibility to have the occasion
succeed rested on their shoulders
Led by a young local

Parmuat;

Members of the
other
sub-clan
of
lelema
graciously
accepted
the
leadership of Joseph Parmuat and their other cousins and
all worked harmoniously and tirelessly to
about the
success that was already evident that morning:
From
the
verandah
of
his
house,
Ole
Kaelo
surveyed with utter satisfaction all that was happening in
his homestead:
He
was most
grateful and felt humbled
by the fact that; in that ancestral land to which he had

only
the
promise
of   monetary
payment   would have induced
such

young men and women to turn Up. With trembling lips
and tears welling in his eyes, he swore under his breath
that never
in his life, would he ever abandon the
culture of his people o live outside his clan; Ilmolelian.
Its twin sub-clans of Iloorasha-kineji and lelema; would
always be like two chambers of his heart that incessantly
pumped
the
blood  that   sustained him
Regaining  his
composure, he walked back into the house.

She involuntarily gasped, her

felt
angry, terrified and isolated even when they were in the
midst of the happy
of revelers that was oblivious
of what had befallen them:
It was at five o'clock when Simiren charmingly
invited all those present to
savour his   brother's   lavish
hospitality. The elders and their wives were ushered into
Ole Kaelo's spacious living room while the young men;
young women and the children mingled happily in the
lush; sprawling well-tended lawn:
Soon;
the
ever
dutiful   daughters
of Ilmolelian
moved to and fro among the chattering throng with trays
heavily laden with pieces of meat that the revellers ate
ravenously
to
their
fill.
When
beverages
had
been
distributed all round and everyone had had their share,
the young people departed having acknowledged that
true   descendant of  Ilmolelian
had finally  arrived
and
taken his
rightful position in the clan:

Soon
after;
the

Within no time, one could

over the hubbub of talk and laughter _
And as the pleasurable and lively celebration progressed,
voices   became animated; hands  and
arms
gesticulated
vigorously while heads turned more often: Eyes searched
out acquaintances within the throng of revelers 
And it was all pomp and gaiety as
adorned
and bejeweled fingers fluttered; bare shoulders gleamed
in
the   light;   multi-coloured
bead
ornaments   glittered
upon elaborately bedecked necks; pendulous ilmiintoni
of all colours dangled loosely down extended ear-lobes;
and the bright colours of lesos; kangas, red shukas and
multicolored blankets, all turned the
Ole Kaelo
room into a
kaleidoscope of shifting light and colour:
That
evening; Mama Milanoi;
perfect hostess,
was
woman
with   glamour.
She
was   resplendently
dressed in purple silk and moved happily from one group
to the other
cheerfully: her laughter ringing
pleasantly.
That was her home and that was her evening:
She had to make sure that no one present in that
room would leave with any shred of doubt in his or her
heart
as
to
who
was
the
enopeny
of the
Ole
Kaelo homestead.
Taiyo

amusement
as

another
when suddenly her eye caught sight of

Across
the
room;

directed
Mama Milanoi to look at the direction of her daughter;
Taiyo;
in
time
to
see
two
events
happening
simultaneously:
handsome young man striding towards
her   daughter
and
her
husband   sending
seemingly
corrosive glance in the direction of his daughter.
One
can
never
tell
with
Ole
Kaelo,
Mama
Milanoi
thought   aloud
He
can
be
the
most   dreadful
spoilsport.
Ole Kaelo, however; did not interfere and Mama
Milanoi watched
across the room;
smiling a little,
as the two young people met_
How lovely Taiyo looked
that night! She thought she was her very image when she
was at her age. She watched the two as
exchanged
greetings and their smiles as their eyes
met.
Then
he
seemed
to ask her
question and she, with downcast
eyes, gave him
a demure smile. For
a moment, Mama
Milanoi stood there allowing
ridiculous small blade of
envy cut through her heart_
She let her heart wander and
wondered
what   might   have happened
had
she
met
handsome young man such as the one her daughter was
speaking with, fallen in love and got married. If she had
had such
an
opportunity, what might her life have been?
Maybe she would not have been joined at the hip with
bully like
'Do you know that young man your daughter is
talking to?" It was her brother-in-law Simiren standing
beside her: "She needs to be informed immediately.
"Is he a bad boy?" Mama Milanoi asked urgently
fearing for her daughter
from
they

"Far from it;" Simiren answered reassuringly _
"In
fact he is one of the finest and dependable young men
that we have in Nasila_
"What's Taiyo to be informed about him, then?"
Mama Milanoi asked, puzzled  "Or is he married and has
a vicious wife?"
"You
are
wrong   again;
Simiren   said
broadly. "It is simply this, the young man whose name is
Joseph Parmuat is
a brother to your daughter: Parmuat,
his father is of the clan of Ilmolelian of Iloorasha-kineji
sub-clan; like ourselves_
It is, therefore, not oly
great
abomination
if
we
were
to
allow
their
ignorance
to
desecrate Nasila cultural values, but their illicit contact
would
be
taboo
that
is
bound
to
have
untold
consequences on uS all:
From the corner where she stood watching the
noisy events in the
room; Resian saw the meeting
of her sister and the lithe young man who she had earlier
in the
said was handsome. For some strange reason,
she felt alarmed.
Was it jealousy consuming her?
But
why should she be jealous of her sister?
it was not
jealousy.
It
was  fear:
It
was the fear of
Taiyo_
Taiyo was hers. She was her oly sister; her oly friend
and her only ally.
She could not dare lose her or share
her love with anybody. Never
When she gave thought to
the possibility; her young heart nearly stopped beating:
For
brief; almost frightening moment; she allowed the
negative emotions take the
better of her.
She
swore
inkilani-e-papaai
she would hate
anyone,
who
came
between her and
sister.
Taiyo saw her sister come and she thought how
timely her arrival was, for she had wanted to share that
smiling
living
day
No
losing
her

moment of joy and ecstasy with someone close to her:
She smiled dazzlingly as she introduced the two to each
other:
Resian was rewarded by
a twinkle in the young
man's eyes
as he shook
her delicate  soft hand.
There
followed a brief; slightly awkward silence. Around them,
the talk and the laughter of the revellers rose and fell like
the sound of waves beating upon flooded river banks_
Before
had time to say another word, uncle Simiren
and
their
mother
stood beside them_
It chagrined Taiyo greatly to be told
of her clan's relations with the young man she had just
met_
Then the time finally came_
It was the time to
formally receive Parsimei Ole Kaelo and his family back
into the Ilmolelian fold and into the larger family of the
Nasila people and offer blessings for his family's well
To conduct the sacred ceremony was an old man
who had been sitting in the company of other two old
men at a corner f the
living room
He was sagging with
age and his face was splodged with
a maze of wrinkles_
His lips had collapsed
on his toothless gums while his
scalp showed patches of white skin through his thin grey
hair:
Earlier in the evening Taiyo had looked at the old
man with
piteous face as he sat with his elbows on the
table, holding a joint of mutton in both hands and, trying
to gnaw on it.
Seeing how much he struggled, obviously
with very little success, she had sympathised with him_
She had gone into the kitchen fetched
plateful of rice,
peas, beans and potatoes and handed it to him:

Ole
Kaelo's   daughter,
answered
Taiyo
impatiently not wanting to prolong the discussion with
the decrepit old man:
Later;
Taiyo
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
seemingly helpless and toothless old man; was one of the
most revered elders in the community. She saw him get
up from
where he sat with the other two old men; and
leaning heavily on his walking stick
moved to the centre
of the living room_
His pace was dignified as he walked
with his chin up and his mouth set in a hard straight line
That
was
the   time
that
Taiyo
observed
his
heavily
wrinkled face_
There was
haughty set to his features_
For
a moment,
Taiyo felt as if he had fastened his eyes
on her and that his gaze was like a physically oppressive
force upon her. She suddenly felt much in awe of him.
When he began to speak;
his voice boomed and
its  resonance  filled the crowded
room
He  introduced
himself as old Ole Musanka; a member of the Ilmakesen
clan and of Ilterito age-set_
He said Nasila was
a Maa
house   and  anybody
born   of Maa,
was   entitled
to
its
shelter.
Maa culture was the blood and marrow that gave
sustenance to the body. And the body was the collective
masses of Maa. Ole Kaelo, he said, was a tiny strand of
hair that had been blown away from its owner's head by
of wind.
The same wind that had blown it away
had blown the strand back onto its owner's head. He said
the head could not refuse to receive back the returning
eyed
gust

strand.
But the ous was upon the strand to attach and
coil itself back onto the rest of the hair on the head and
blend with it. If it did not, he warned, it would
and
get trampled upon the ground.
He advised Ole Kaelo to
re-assimilate himself into his people's culture.
"Those of uS who have been listening to the sound of our
cattle bells,
he said quoting the children's song, "know
that the Ole Kaelo's cattle are home-bound:
were
bound to come, for the founder said when a rat begins to
smell, it returns to its mother's home.
And home is never
far
from
one
who is   still
alive,
one of the elders interjected.
And
speaking
of   home,"
Ole
Musanka
said
candidly,
"Ole
Kaelo
must be told,
home is
not  this
house however
magnificent it  may
be_
Home is  Maa;
home is Nasila, home is family and home is the children
Kill one of the four pillars, and there is no home to speak
about   Sever yourself from
the
culture of your people
and you effectively become olkirikoi,
a man of no fixed
abode, your elegant house notwithstanding: Where are
the women of Maa? Embrace the wife and children of
Ole Kaelo and
them back into the Nasila
fold.
Where are the elders of Ilmolelian? There is your man_
Cut him loose from the snares  of alien cultures_

Then he had a parting shot for
Taiyo and Resian 
'Do
not listen to crusaders of an alien culture that is
being   perpetrated

After that voluble curse, the old man blessed the

evening: He prophesied that she will be

But Mama Milanoi was troubled.

CHAPTER FIVE
Confusion reigned supreme in the forlorn hearts
of the two daughters of Ole Kaelo, immediately after the
homecoming
ceremony
Feelings
of
anger,
helplessness and hopelessness alternated in their minds.
Taiyo
was the first to be overcome by lethargic
feelings. She sluggishly left the now nearly empty living
room for their bedroom
Resian remained behind for
moment helping their mother and other
women
gather
and move utensils to the kitchen and tidy the room.
When
she   finally

the   bedroom, Resian
found it half-lit and

angrily sharp.
Taiyo tensed
a   little
as   her
sister slid into the bed beside her:
"Taiyo-e-yeiyo,
she called huskily;

as
she settled in bed, a thread of miserable anger discernible
in her voice. "Taiyo-e-yeiyo, doi.

normal, feigning sleep. She wondered what her sister's
grouse could be at that time, for she always had a grouse
about  something;
if it
was
mistreatment by
their
father; it was her failure to talk to their father to allow
them go back to Nakuru to join the Egerton University_
But   she had
no
qualms that night about  soothing her
sister's sour mood.
It
was
true  that she had promised
to   approach
their father about their possibility of attending university,
but it was equally true that an
appropriate opportunity
had not availed itself: She knew the importance her sister

not

attached to the subject and did not want, therefore, to
rush
it.
She
was
aware
too that, that   afternoon,
her
attention had been drawn away from the narrow confines
of her sister's troubles. Yes, even if it was for
brief
moment,  when  she stood with Joseph Parmuat in their
room, she had felt justifiably separated from her
sister.
But
was
that  natural?
After  all,
were
not
children any more, and very soon
would physically
be   separated.
Each
would
have
to
fend
for   herself
Furthermore,
that   afternoon;
when
she    listened
to
the
children sing and watched them dance. When she later
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
to  Joseph
Parmuat
about
music, she became aware of a restlessness that she would
have considered totally alien to her nature
It was as if
she stood on the threshold of an unknown room; Or on
mountain top, excitedly waiting for the sun
to rise
at
dawn to reveal a breathtakingly beautiful scenery which
she had not seen before.
Later that night; lying with her back to her sister;
Taiyo allowed her mind to float
fleetingly. Like
swift
light cherub, it glided into all directions opening; probing,
and analysing recent events in their lives that had been
most tormenting: Lying on her
back beside her sister
Resian
felt
Taiyo's
warmth
and
heard
her
steady
breathing, as she stared grimly into the darkness, feeling
unhappy, afraid and utterly alone. She too was troubled.
It was a
night for the two girls.
The
of
the insects, the croaking of the
and the mournful
calls of the night birds, echoed through the dark house as
on their bed, each oe of them awake but deep
in thought

they

"Away
with the barbaric   culture,
cried  Taiyo
bitterly, "Away with the archaic way of life_
She wept until she had no more tears in
eyes;
then she sobbed dryly. Was there no guarantee of justice
in life?
How could she come
across the man who she
thought
would   have
filled
the
void
in
her
heart
SO
fittingly and instantly lose him
to the ancient doubtful
ancestral links? She was angry with everybody in Nasila;
but more so with her uncle Simiren who she infuriatingly
blamed for ruining her relationship with Joseph Parmuat.
The
mere
mention
of
Joseph
Parmuat's
name
evoked delightful feelings that warmly excited her heart:
She wondered whether he too could be sleepless at that
very hour thinking of her: Did he know before that
were of the same clan and, therefore, forbidden to have
any
heterosexual
links
whatsoever?
She
thought
the
gross unfairness of the outdated culture was definitely

her
and
to
all others
who
were   of

But
not
all
was
lost   though;
she   reasoned,

Within
the few minutes
had stood there in the
room;
Joseph Parmuat had made two promises: to visit her in
their home the following day and if her parents agreed,
he would coach her in the traditional music and dance
she was so much interested in. And her mother who was
then present had said, to her delight, that the young man
was welcome to visit them the following day _
But for the
other
request
about
coaching;
her
mother
had
categorically refused to be drawn into it, saying that it
was
Taiyo's fathers territory.

Should Joseph Parmuat fulfill those two promises
she would
be utterly satisfied
But all depended on her

Resian's situation grew

Whether their cause
in the inescapable loneliness that
seemed to stalk her like

or in the
intolerable

the

insecurity, she could not tell.
All she knew was that her
world was spinning: Even her bed seemed to be moving
The

After rummaging about

What   sent   shivers   right  deep
into the pit of Resian's

her
mind,
was
the   olmurunya:
That

Resian did not find it funny. When she thought of
the barbaric operation, she felt scared and inched closer
to Taiyo who lay there beside her _
She thought of the
aggressive young man who grinned impudently at them
and

She was angry with

She   stirred
and  struggled
out of bed, grimly
set   about
to

another day.
Taiyo also stirred.
She did not uncover her head,
though  She was glad to have
a few more minutes under
the blankets to collect her thoughts and feelings before
another day. For after an all but sleepless night in
the dark hours, her emotions had alternated alarmingly
between
an
overwhelming
and
indisputable
reckless
elation when she thought of Joseph Parmuat and anger;
panic and bitterness borne of the disturbing recent events_
It was morning also in the master bedroom and
Parsimei was
waking up.
He lazily turned in his bed,
opened his eyes, and yawned:
mighty master's yawn_
For
a  moment; he listened to the birds that chirruped
away in the trees that surrounded his house and his heart
gladdened.
He sent a furtive glance at his wife who was
still asleep beside him and smiled at her childlike face as
she

He was elated:

Mama

mind

Her  eyes
focused.
She opened them  wide  and paid attention
to
what her husband was saying: She knew his words could
completely change their lives and the lives of their two
daughters
In all those years
had lived in Nakuru and as
raised the
to
maturity, she had known that her
husband was not a strict adherent of the Nasila traditions_
He had insisted upon the outward observance of those
traditions
that
he
considered
to
be
the   hallmark
of
decency. But as he had said, she knew as much as he did
the demands of the culture into which
had plunged
themselves.
Born and brought up in that culture, she knew the
extent of its tentacles_
She was aware that as
family,
were already in breach of the tradition for keeping
at home their  grown up girls

into young

was

do;
to prepare

daughters;
physically
and
mentally;
to
face

Those
were the words, whose utterance she so
dreaded. And once uttered, she knew, the words instantly
became an inviolable edict.
Now that he had spoken; the
pain was already harrowing and the torment in her heart
unbearable.
She
was
torn
between
her
love
for
her
daughters and her dutiful role of a faithful and obedient
wife of Ole Kaelo. But in her culture there was no room
for dissent, especially if the subject was in conformity

with the culture.
Who would side with her if she were to
oppose the cultural rituals?
Her only ally would be the woman the elders of
Nasila   contemptuously called   entangoroi
or   the
wasp:
Those who honoured her called her Emakererei, for she
was
to
have
attended
Makerere
University
in
Uganda;
where
she  obtained her degree in Veterinary
Science. Mama Milanoi knew her well. Her actual names

was

managing an expansive government

to
hold
hundreds
of  thousands
of
about
one
hundred kilometers away from Nasila.
Under her were
hundreds of employees who worked at the ranch_
In Nasila, however; she was regarded as the devil
incarnate. She was hated and reviled for criticizing and
campaigning  vigorously
the traditions that  she
said   abused
the   rights   of the girl child  namely
circumcision and early marriages
And that had
her
in
direct   collision
with
the   people
of   Nasila.

that he

his hubris.

Resian scowled her displeasure for being berated
but nevertheless   closed her book and scurried back to
their bedroom:
Later in the
Ole Kaelo took his  wife and
daughters to Nasila stores, to show them their brand new
business. They were impressed and instantly liked it. The
shop had opened for business two days earlier and it was
already full of customers.
It
was
splendid,  large
and
well
stocked:
The
decor was discreetly and fashionably done while taking
into
consideration
the
kind
of
customers
that
were
expected. The mahogany and brass counters and display
cases
gleamed:
The display boards on the walls carried
all kinds of tools, accessories and fittings.
The tiled floor
was
polished to
shiny sheen while beveled and etched
glass  and mirrors  nailed
on  strategic pillars and walls
reflected every image and glint of light with sparkling
clarity. On a
float in the middle of the shop, a range
of
equipment
was
exhibited
with
masterly
cra
ftsmanship;
their
superior
quality
complementing
perfectly
the   surroundings
that   had
been
created
to
display them: There were milk pails, milk cans, buckets,
and cream  separators.  Beside
them
were  animal feeds
and licks of all brands.
Also displayed were herbicides,
insecticides, acaricides and fungicides.
Resian,
eyeing
the
splendor
with
rather
jaundiced eye, nudged her  sister   and
whispered,
"All
these
must have cost Papaai

"Surely, Resian; can't you see?" Taiyo whispered

us those dresses and shoes? You loved the grandeur and
splendor
of the place, did you not? It  made you  feel
special:  Well, that is what Papaai is trying to create here_
Should he say
he has spent all his money here,
I will
understand. And I dare say, it is well spent!"
Resian looked around her: Satisfying customers,
Or
creating
suitable ambience to attract future profits
were ,
to  her;
much
important
than
her   burning
ambition to go to the university.
She cast her eyes to the
ceiling and then turned and once more looked around her
and said nonchalantly. "Well, if you say $0, big sister:

reverently

At last, Maison led them into a neat office where
a young, beautiful secretary ushered them into

CHAPTER SIX
Whether
it
was
by
coincidence
or
by
prior
arrangement, the girls could not tell But as soon as
had finished serving supper to Joseph Parmuat and the
stranger, their father came into the house through the
back door: He greeted the two men with little enthusiasm
and proceeded to the living room:
As was their habit;
when their father came into the living room; the girls
quickly gathered the dishes, tidied the table and instantly
disappeared into the kitchen:
No
sooner had
gone into the kitchen than
their   mother
summoned   them; their  father
wanted
to
speak to them
The girls immediately looked up at their
mother enquiringly, apprehensive of the rare summon_
Their father usually preferred talking to them through
their mother:
With trepidation;
trooped back to the
living room, steeling themselves to hear whatever he had
to say.
The father sat in his armchair
facing the fireplace
while their mother sat at the end of the sofa.
The
went to sit next to their mother: Joseph Parmuat sat in an
armchair not
far from their father and the stranger
had not left the
table where he sat alone_
When
he began to speak;
their   father   did
not
address
them
directly.
Instead
he
addressed   Joseph
Parmuat.
The girls knew their father well:
He liked to
address issues and expound o them in order to impress
points upon his audience_
And he was always impressive
when he made his speeches.
When
lived in Nakuru;
he

occasions,
and
loved
to  listen
to
his
pompous
speeches
So
after
meandering
and
digressing;
in
the
process
Parmuat of the difficulties he encountered
going to school and how he began to plan for his own
future very early in his life, he finally came to the point.
"These children may not know,
he said suddenly
turning his   attention
to
his   daughters_
may
not
know and
want to tell them
now, that you
are their
brother:
You
are no lesser
brother to them than their
own mother's son would have been:
You are my son a8
much
as their mother's
son  would have
been
my
son
Perhaps their mother has already told them; and if she
has not, she will tell them tonight that Parmuat's family
and Kaelo's family are one. We are all of Ilmolelian clan;
of Iloorasha-kineji sub-clan.
He told Joseph Parmuat that he had brought up
his daughters well. They were well behaved and that he
was proud of them: However; having been away from
Nasila all their lives, they had missed out

cultural values that harmonised the lives of Nasila people.
In addition
to
what

or
in
addition to what
were
to learn through books, he
stressed,
it
was
imperative
that
learned   habits,
traditions and their culture that would make their parents
and the
Nasila   people proud of them_
He added that;
although
he   considered the girls  intelligent,  there
was
need for them to develop into responsible mature women
of the future.
That was necessary; he said emphatically,
because
there
was
nothing better that parents  looked
forward to, than to see their children settle in their own
homes.
He had hastened to add that although, at their

age
might
consider
what
he
was
saying
as
ridiculously irrelevant
he knew by
experience that there
was
nothing better than beginning to plan
one's future
early.
He  warned the girls that
might find
a few
cultural demands obnoxious but
would have to be
stoic and accept them with the understanding that it was
those not-too-pleasant traditions that nurtured and bound
their
people   together_
And
those
families
that
had
refused to rejoin their people,
he added thoughtfully;
"had been blasted into smithereens by alien cultures_
"It   should
never

he
concluded
dramatically:
When
their
mother
spoke
to
them
later;
emphasising what their father had told them;
wore
blank faces
and   deliberately   concealed their  reaction_
She therefore, did not realise that
held   extremely
divergent views_
That was the most
exciting news that Taiyo had
received
ever
since
came
to
Nasila.
She
was
exultant. Although their father never for once mentioned
that   Joseph  Parmuat
was
to
coach
her
in
traditional
music and dance, the fact that he had allowed them to
interact  with
him  filled her heart with joy:
She could
hardly hide her elation. Even the repeated assertion that
Joseph
Parmuat
was   their
brother by  virtue
of their
cultural links, failed to daunt her spirit.
Was she simply
infatuated  with him? If she
was, she hoped the feeling
would
soon
simmer
down.
What   pleased
her
most;
however;
was that she now had
a confidant whom she
could ask some of those embarrassing questions that she
could not dare ask her mother or anybody else.
they
for
they
they
they

It was, however; different for Resian: Deep right
into her heart  she
was
seething with
ire_
It irked
her
terribly
to
have
had
to
listen
to
their
father
as
he
prepared them for a journey that she thought was to lead
them back to the stone-age era. She scornfully dismissed
the
cultural
coaching
that
Joseph
Parmuat
was
to
undertake as worthless She likened the whole saga to
grown-up person whose mind degenerated into an idiot
and had to content with playing with mud
It was utter
foolishness!
"It may
not
be
as
bad
as
you   imagine,
little
sister
Taiyo said,
trying
to mollify her angry  sister;
"maybe by the time brother Parmuat is through with us
we shall be the wiser_
"Wiser indeed!" jeered Resian, "Yes, by the time
he shall be through with us, we shall have been taught a
lesson in stoicism_
We won't blink or wince even aS
enkamuratani mutilates our
sexuality into smithereens!"
After
got to their bedroom, Taiyo poured tea
from
flask that she carried from the kitchen; into two
cups.  She handed
one
to
Resian
who took it without
raising her eyes
Taiyo was already aware of the tension
between them:
In all their lives, only twice had they had
a   serious   quarrel:
On each of those occasions,
Taiyo
recalled, the hurt had been exacerbated by the breaking
of
bond
that
had   always
been
SO
firm
as
to
be
unquestioned But the two had
resilient character and
no sooner had
quarreled than they were reconciled
The problem that time round
was that
did not see
things in the same light:
Whereas   she
was  also
happy
that
now had Joseph Parmuat as a brother who
would interact with and discuss some of the perplexing

questions   that bedevilled them, Resian   suspected
that
Taiyo would use her newly acquired acquaintance with
him
to
marginalize her:
And   she
was
not ready
to
be
abandoned by her sister:
Resian
much later in the night, fully clothed
except for  shoes and
jacket,  listening to her  sister's
slight and
delicate
snores
next
to her underneath
the
blankets.
She turned and took her by the shoulder and
rocked her slightly.
"Taiyo-e-yeiyo, are you asleep?"
She heard Taiyo move and turn to face her:
Then
she dimly saw her as she lifted herself upon her elbow to
level herself with her:
And on her part,
Resian leaned
forward, speaking very softly. "Im disturbed;
she said.
"Im beginning
to
think it is disadvantageous being
woman in this society.
"For  heaven's   sake,
Resian;
exclaimed   Taiyo,
making
a small sound, affectionate and exasperate. "Is it
worth staying awake the whole night thinking of such
mundane things?"
"Call
them
mundane,
Resian
pursued
relentlessly.
"But
I keep  wondering
what   would have
happened had we been sons_
Do you think father would
have  looked for

"Resian, honestly;

The  following afternoon, when Joseph Parmuat
came to visit them 
the
mysterious stranger also
came
He
wore
shabby, black-woolen-suit and
clean
but
wrinkled
white   shirt.
He
had
had
haircut   and
his
previously bushy moustache had been trimmed. Even his
muddy shoes had been cleaned and polished to
bright
black
sheen:
He
came
carrying
on
his   shoulder;
hindquarter  of mutton  wrapped
up
in
khaki
brown
paper _
Mama Milanoi received the meat gratefully.
That
had become the man's habit. He would disappear oly to
saunter in like the owner of the house two days later;
bringing with him either a
of flour; a
of sugar; a
quarter of mutton O
bundle of lamb chops.
He
would hand over his gifts to Mama Milanoi quietly and
because the house
was  always   frequented by visitors;
any additional food stuff was always welcome.
Later the girls
came to
know that the stranger
was   known
as
Olarinkoi
Whether
their
father
had
known him before,
could not tell.
What
came
to acknowledge
was that their father had accepted the
strange man's presence in his home graciously_
And soon
the man made his
useful and his services invaluable
and indispensable. He would often come very early
in
the morning to tend
the   flower  gardens and  slash
the
grass
on
the
lawn.
By
the   time

breakfast; he would be sitting silently ready to eat with

strangely counted him as
one of them
when preparing
meals.
On his part, Olarinkoi acted almost indifferently
towards
and Resian.
He directed his attention to
their parents_
What perplexed the girls was his ever silent
presence
in their house.
He
was  always there, sitting
quietly and staring unblinkingly, like
leopard
would
while stealthily stalking an antelope.
Joseph Parmuat did not like Olarinkoi:
The two
hardly acknowledged one another's presence and most of
the time they did not even exchange greetings
But when
Joseph
Parmuat
discussed

with
the   girls,
Olarinkoi would listen
keenly
to

Once in

butt in and give his

The following

Taiyo sat quietly as Joseph Parmuat narrated the
moving
of the legendary Olarinkoi:
The saga of the extremely brutal  and despotic
rule of Olarinkoi and his tyrannical warriors that were
known as Ilarinkon, remained permanently etched in the
collective psyche of the Maa people.

that
Olarinkoi suddenly emerged from

then it more than did it! They were not only shocked by
the towering giant that sauntered swaggeringly towards
them;  but
his

sent   shivers  right

The man was more of a monster than human:

He pointed it at the

He relented.
But it
was his shield that was most scary. It was s0 huge that it
was carried by four men:

On

That morning, Taiyo had left
the shop in
the company of their father:
She had excitedly promised
Resian that if all went well
she would definitely bring
up the subject of their enrolment at Egerton University
So,

Taiyo
learnt   from  Joseph
Parmuat that  female
circumcision
was initiated by women themselves about two hundred
years earlier.
And that it was as
a result of sexual abuse

and his warriors _
Is that true, Yeiyo? [ thought it was one
of those
myths
that
were
created
by
men
to
blame

"What   Joseph
Parmuat
told  Taiyo
is   factually
correct;
her
mother told her   confidently
"It

"That  may have  been

said  looking
directly into her mother's eyes

Suddenly, his voice becoming softer
and almost intimate, he whispered,
"Ill be happy to tell
him
what

"Who else is
here in the house?"

Resian answered nonchalantly.
"Perhaps you will tell her that I am here to see
your father
"Tll do
Resian said impatiently as she stepped
back
But before she could complete her statement; he
had brushed past her in one swift movement that nearly
caught her off-balance. In a flash; he had pushed his way
into
the
living room
and
as   he  passed
by   her;
she
certainly
felt  the   fingers   of his lifted
hand
the
fullness
of
her
breast.
With
surge
of
outraged
embarrassment;
she
glared
at
him
viciously.
She
muttered inaudibly; "what an ill-mannered devil this man
is!"
And as she fled to the kitchen she felt those black
eyes;   sharp
and  probing,  moving  like
creepy   fingers
upon her back:
"No;

Her mother was stirring
vegetable stew when
Resian
entered,
and
she   glanced   abstractedly
at
her_
"Who was that?" she asked:
A

she
said acidly. "He says he has come to see Papaai.
"Oloisudori?

her
mother said repeatedly, rolling her eyes to the ceiling as
she tried to place the name. Failing to remember where
she had heard that  name, she shook her head,

"Whoever he is_

"Check your tongue, child!" her mother rebuked
her harshly.

busy

Reluctantly, Resian  took
a flask that contained
tea and
and slowly walked back to the living room_
The
moment   she
reappeared,
Resian
saw
Oloisudori
crane his neck; watching her:
She quickly placed the
flask and cup on the table and her hands automatically
flew to the buttons of her
that she suddenly felt;
from the look in his eyes, must have been unbuttoned
But she found them intact.
"It
must
have
taken
for
you
to
decide
whether to give me
cup of tea?" he said sarcastically:
The man's words shocked Resian and she backed away
from him
In
the process, she   collided
with
nearby
coffee table and nearly lost her balance.
"Sorry,"
she
said
regaining
her
balance
and
composure. "But we always serve tea to our visitors even
when our mother has not told us to do so_
"In that case, I must apologize for my mistaken
thought;'
Oloisudori said as he took the cup of tea.
He
let a small
suggestive silence grow between them before
saying; "Im indeed sOrry; pretty lady.
Then he smiled at
her; a demonic and intrusive smile_
For the very few minutes she stood before him;
she felt his black languorous eyes move up and down her
face   and
body
with
a   relentless  intimacy
that   nearly
immobilized her with embarrassment.
She felt as if his
hands were all over her body caressing her against her
will: She even felt angry with herself; when she reasoned
that
by  standing
there
she
was
encouraging
him
to
humiliate
her:
But
somehow,
it
was
as
if

She shook her head as

he said once more in
his intimate voice, his huge, slanting eyes probing her;
stripping  her
naked,   assessing her;  shaming
her   and
judging her:

Just   then,

"Have   you

irritably aghast at Resian's   queer  behaviour_
"Why do

"Im SOrY, Papaai,

Oloisudori said importantly, struggling to stand in order
to receive Ole Kaelo's hug:
"I assure you all
are
under control
It
was then that Resian, who had followed her
father to the
living room noted that the two men were of
the same height and possibly of the same age. But what
greatly perturbed her,
was to hear
slight tremor in her
father's voice as he addressed Oloisudori:

"Where   is   your  mother?"
Ole Kaelo   suddenly
asked turning to Resian
But before she could answer; he
was
already   calling
her   out  loudly  using her   formal
maternal name, "Ngoto Taiyo.
"Yes;

Resian's
mother

"Come

irritably.  "Resian; for heaven's  sake, what are you still
doing here? Go to the kitchen at oce and make yourself
usefull"
"Yes, Papaai,
Resian   answered   demurely.
But
before
she   disappeared,
Oloisudori detained
her
for
moment with
a wave of his hand to say;
'Brother Ole
Kaelo, you
have
wonderful  daughter
here_
Inyour
absence, she received
and
entertained
me in the most
delightful manner_
Ole Kaelo snorted and grunted but
said nothing:
When
Mama
Milanoi   appeared,
her
husband
introduced
her
to
Oloisudori.
He
then
became
lyrical about Oloisudori's pivotal role that gave them the
financial stability

enjoying in Nasila. He
mentioned the contracts that he had assisted him to win
and others that were still in the pipeline.
This man is
more than a brother to me;
he said emotionally "There's
nothing, and I repeat; nothing that he ought to be denied
in this home_
Resian shut the door behind her and effectively
off her father's effusive praise of the man she loathed.
She
walked
through
the
kitchen
to

Opening it slowly she got out, shut it behind

when
she
thought
of
those
shamelessly
questing eyes. Was there no better man that her father
could find to do business   with? Then she remembered
her sister Taiyo and the promise to speak to their father
"Oh; my God;
she exclaimed to herself excitedly; "Im
standing here   foolishly thinking of Oloisudori's
antics,
while

She
felt
sure
Taiyo
had   spoken
to
their
father
and
possibly
he
had
already
consented.
She
stood quite still for a moment.
She was enthralled.
Then
she quickly walked round the house and
back to the
front.
As
she walked
to
the gate, she
saw
her   sister
sitting o
next to Joseph Parmuat:

Her

was

Taiyo knew her sister's expectation:
As soon
as

to where
were seated, she explained to
her; how she tried, without success, to talk to their father.
She had hoped
to find him alone and
in
an
agreeable
mood, but all that had proven difficult.
Strangely, for the  first time, she found Resian
understanding: Instead of getting sulky, as she often did,
she said she had appreciated her sister's effort and that

the door was still open
She was sure an
opportune time would offer itself, and at that time, she
believed, divine powers would have prevailed upon their

"Papaai

his

eyes

with
surprised amusement
"Honestly, Resian;

Taiyo said still in stitches
"Only

"And for some reasons, Papaai seems terrified of him:
"Papaai, of all people, terrified?" Taiyo said wide-eyed

asked  perceiving
that   the

him while roaring with laughter:
"Did you say Oloisudori? Of all peoplel" Joseph
Parmuat
exclaimed
to
the
consternation
of
the
"That man is bad news! He is a monster in the true sense
of the word.
"Who is
he?"  the   girls
asked
simultaneously_
"What kind of person is he?"
Oloisudori was
feared man not oly in Nasila
but far and wide. If there was anything obnoxious that
exploded

girls

girls.

Nasila had ever exported to other parts of the country;
apart   from
the ancient  infamous
cattle   raids   and
the
services
of
the
enkamuratani
it
was
the
notorious
criminality of Oloisudori. Just as his name implied, he
was a
shadowy figure. Nobody seemed to know his exact
business_
He liked to refer to himself as
jack-of-all-
trade, which
was
true
because
he had his   fingers
on
agriculture, finance, tourism; import and export; mining
and motor trade.
He
was also known to be
poacher;
smuggler and robber:
But what he perfected skillfully
was
an extortionist.
That went hand in hand with
his other specialised role of a hired assassin
He did not
play all those roles alone as his gang of collaborators and
agents worked under his direct supervision.
Little
was
known
of
Oloisudori's   background.
Those older than him said he came to Nasila when he
was
boy of ten:
It
was  said he
was adopted by the
family of Loonkiyaa who brought him up alongside their
other sons. He was circumcised with the rest of the sons
and became
valorous
moran.
But after his  stint as
moran, he turned into a hardcore criminal who had been
jailed o numerous occasions
He
was
now said to
be
incorrigible and the fact that he was often successful in
his   criminal   forays, however  devious
were, often
portrayed
wrong image to the
who thought he
offered an alternative route to wealth and riches_
It was aS an extortionist that Oloisudori excelled.
In
most   cases
he enticed his  victims by loaning them
sums of money
or  organising for them
to clinch
and sign lucrative contracts with big organisations O win
attractive contracts to supply agricultural inputs to
parastatals. Once his victims were deeply involved in the
being

large

business; he would turn up to make ridiculous demands
and threaten to withdraw the contracts_
In many cases;
his victims were left with little options but to play to his
own rules.
The consequences of not playing the game as
he wished, were always brutal and unpalatable.
By the time Joseph Parmuat was through with the
monster's history, the
were near tears_
feared
their father and for themselves. They wondered why
their father had got himself involved with that monster's
murky business
Was the house
were
living in and
the business that their father had founded,
financed by
the monster? Resian
was
even
more  fearful when
she
recalled the anxiety that was evident in their father's face
when
he
found
Oloisudori
in
their house.
When
she
recalled the condescension that Oloisudori had displayed
while in their
room, she was in no doubt that their
father had fallen victim of the demonic extortionist.
But
Taiyo
looked
at
things
from
brighter
perspective_
She
was   convinced that their father could
not be that naive as to get involved with such
an
evil
man-
She reasoned that there
must have been  another
explanation
the monster's visit to their home. But the
three
agreed
on
one thing: Oloisudori was
bad,
bad
man_
After   sitting
on
the
chatting
for
while,
Joseph
Parmuat
departed.
The
girls
then   proceeded
slowly to their house, talking:
"Guess

Taiyo-eyeiyo,"
Resian
said
excitedly _
"Yeiyo,

Resian
vehemently.
"You

Anyway, tell

Taiyo   pursued the  subject
relentlessly. "What did she say about F.G.M.?"
"She asked me what I knew about it,
Resian said
gesticulating wildly to emphasize her words
'And I told
her not oly what I knew about F.G.M but I added that it

his   visitor:   Taiyo   and
Resian   stepped
back
to
allow
Oloisudori

greeted
Taiyo
politely
and
smiled at Resian confidently as if to suggest that a bond

was

understanding:
Resian
dropped her gaze to the floor_
There goes the monster;
Resian hissed angrily
through
clenched
teeth;
as
her   father
and
Oloisudori
walked
down
the
steps_
"He's
the
devil

Bearing in mind what Joseph Parmuat told uS about him;
Taiyo said nonchalantly.  "Olosudori  could very easily
pass aS just another innocent Nasila elder:
"God forbid, "
Resian hissed, her lips tightening
dangerously. Just the sight of Oloisudori had revived the
loathing she had for him:
"I pray that God
will never
give him a chance to pass as an innocent Nasila elder:
Just then; their father returned. Resian looked at
him and perceived something queer about him: She was
alarmed.
Did   she   imagine
it
or
was
there   something
unnatural about him? She wondered.
And what was it?
Her father looked at her and quickly averted his eyes and
looked elsewhere. She noticed that something was amiss_
She felt very certain there was something awful in the air:
"Resian, go to the kitchen and help your mother
prepare   supper,
her   father  said sharply.
And make it
snappy!'
The look o her father's face immobilized her_
She glanced at him curiously: He was watching her too,
his
wrinkled
face   unsmiling:
She
then   regained
her
composure
and
was
about
to
go
when
once
again
something in his face made her hesitate for
a moment;
thinking he
was   about to
say
something
more to her.

"What are you waiting for?" he thundered angrily.
"Go
to the kitchen this instant.
Taiyo
was by then
closing
windows   and
drawing curtains. Standing by one window that faced the
west; she looked through it for
moment, lost in
thought. Then she walked into the
room where her
father sat rigidly on an armchair, his right elbow planted
on his right knee while his right cupped hand supported
his chin: He was staring without blinking at the fireplace,
his thoughts obviously not in that house.
"Papaai,
Taiyo called her father, looking at him
with reverence. "Is something wrong?"
"What?
Oh

turning unfocused eyes upon her. "Nothing is wrong my

CHAPTER EIGHT
It was the turn of Parsimei Ole Kaelo and Mama

to

turned
and turned again
on
their   bed  repeatedly,

Ole Kaelo's head
spun   incessantly.
He rued the
day   he
met
Oloisudori.  Seeing  what  befell
him
that
afternoon; he wondered what devil had convinced him to
carry
out
business
dealings
with
such
an
evil
man_
Judging from the queer demand Oloisudori had made o
him; he wondered if he was
member of a shadowy cult
that he had heard mentioned for
time, and which
was known as ilmasonik
It was said that the cult thrived on blackmail and
extortion:
One of the ways it operated was to approach
an
ambitious
businessman
and
lure
him
into
their
ensnaring schemes _
A lucrative money-making business
proposal
would
be
hatched
and
handed
to
the
unsuspecting
businessman   by
member
of
the   cult.
Once enticed and convinced that he would make millions
of
shillings
within
short
period
of
time,
the
businessman would be loaned
sums of money
to
plough
into
his
business.
Within
short   time,
the
business
would
boom
and

businessman

prosper:  Then the woes would begin: It
was then that
absurd demands were made. Often; it was demanded that
the indebted businessman sacrifices his beloved ones to
the
of the cult: And the beloved ones included wife,
sons or
daughters. The consequences of failing to fulfill
the demands it was said, were always catastrophic_
He
had
never
believed
those   stories,
but
that
night, as he
on his bed, he began to wonder whether
Oloisudori was not a member of such
cult. What, in the
name of God; had he done to deserve such torment? He
cried
silently
and
bitterly.
Although
he
was
an
experienced businessman; he lamented, he had acted so
perilously as to risk the lives of his family.
He
certainly
had
known
Oloisudori's
criminal
records for a
time_
But he could not tell why he had
turned
blind eye to his enticement_
He had even been
warned  of his villainous behaviour but he declined
to
heed the  warning:  Ole
Supeyo, his friend and mentor;
had told him bluntly that
business with Oloisudori
was
like   toying
with
live
electrified
wire .
He
had
likened Oloisudori's rotten behaviour to that of
randy
he-=
and  warned  him
to keep him away from
his

He knew it was the pursuit of success that made

successful.

one reached that state of affluence,
as   Oloisudori did,
where one was able to live in six ostentatious houses in
six different towns, with
a woman and servants in each
one of them?
No;

Yes, that
was how Oloisudori defined
success;
Ole Kaelo thought bitterly:
And he and many
others
desired to define it in the same way.
The archaic

care of cents and let
shillings take

was
regarded by the likes of Oloisudori to be untenable_
Instant riches, just as instant tea Or instant coffee were
the in
And the instantaneous bliss brought in an
on-the-spot feeling of well

That
was  what everyone wanted,
Ole Kaelo reasoned,
and that was what he himself had always wanted:
And
that was the reason, like a
stinking rotten carcass would
draw
a torrent of flies to itself, people like him and many
others got drawn to the murky business of Oloisudori 
'But now the chicken had come home to roost;
Ole
Kalo
lamented
ruefully.
Oloisudori

He recalled the events of
that afternoon when Oloisudori came calling: Seeing him
in his house unexpectedly, had signaled trouble with his
contracts.
But Oloisudori had allayed his fears, saying all

That had restored his peace
and calmed his frayed nerves_
The success of the

on   those
contracts.
Even

It was, therefore, gratifying
to hear him confirm that all was well:

Then all the women
proceeded to the homestead of the accused, armed with
all kinds of weapons that included firewood, ilkurteta,
ilkipiren, isosiani and their husbands' knobkerries.
The girl had been instructed to act normally and
carry out her
milking duties in the manner she always
did. As usual the old man was there trying to seduce her

another morning that
was dominated by flights of birds that flashed between
the trees in the compound, seemed to bring back sanity

the air alive with their constant motion and their cheerful
calls_
Ole
Kaelo
was
the   first
to
come
out of their
bedroom. His morning greetings were unusually cheerful.
Resian was, however, quick to detect something artificial
in that cheerfulness
She thought their father was
somehow insincere.
Where was his usual insensate anger
that she had come to expect whenever he found her in
room?
Why
were his eyes  shifty and

was not well. She also feared that should he reject it, it
would be impossible to bring it up again: At the end, she

dampen the high spirits that embraced the Kaelo family.

CHAPTER NINE
Joseph Parmuat began to coach Resian and Taiyo
in traditional song and dance_
He did it every evening
after school But soon, Resian's interest in the coaching
quickly
fizzled
out
and
waned.
She
knew
her
unquenchable thirst was in university education and that
could not be substituted for anything else. She eventually
stopped attending and left Taiyo to be coached alone.
Soon;
Taiyo
found
her happiness.
She   looked
forward to seeing Joseph Parmuat
in the
evening,  and
when at the end of the practice session; time came for
them to part, she was reluctant to leave. Over the
weeks, she had unexpectedly discovered

and

understanding: She found

song and dance with someone who through ties of Nasila

Joseph Parmuat also enjoyed Taiyo's  company.
He found it

elicited a deep elation: He was, however; cautious in the
way he expressed that elation  Ever since he knew that

But it had not been  easy for the two of them_

He noticed it and smiled

At the sight of that smile, Taiyo's heart lifted with

shone with innocent serenity from her eyes and softened
the line of her mouth:

theirs, if allowed to develop would be catastrophic to her
and her future.
He himself would not escape castigation
and the punishment that was meted out to offenders by
Nasila culture_
Such punishment would include payment
of compensation
in the  form
of cattle, in addition
to
suffering
public rebuke and undergoing
demeaning
cleansing ceremony:
In order to avoid a situation where he would find
himself alone with Taiyo, he ensured Resian was always
with them
when he taught Taiyo song and
dance. To
achieve that;
he introduced an interesting lesson about
Nasila culture after each coaching session
He selected
aspects of  culture that touched
on the lives of young
people
and
to
his   delight; he
found
Resian   ardently

He told them the
kinds of love that young people in Nasila were involved
in. There was the conventional kind where a young man

those

engaging in dangerous stunts to win the
hearts_
And
there
was
nothing that filled the girls with  admiration
more than the mention of valorous feats such as killing
of marauding lions
or
defending the people and
their
cattle from enemies, that the young men often engaged
themselves in:
Those   who excelled in those feats  and
were known to be of

always the darlings of the girls.

accolade that

And the song of
praise was only adopted by all the women when there
was an agreement and consensus by all the young people
that
the
deeds
mentioned
in
the
song
were
indeed
valorously achieved by him
When that happened,
the
young man would bask in that glory until another young
man broke that record by achieving better results.

When
that
enkaputi
was
sealed
and
the   marriage
ceremony performed, the young people regarded that as
the   greatest   achievement;
that
was
always
the
most
blissful marriage in Nasila.
The other kind of love was called patureishi:
It
ran simultaneously with the conventional kind of love, in
that a young man and a girl were individually allowed by
culture
to
have
patureishi
love
alongside
the
conventional type of love.
Patureishi was a
platonic love
that each young person was allowed to engage in
And
the way it operated was that;

girl who was not related to him in any way, and who was
known to be of
behaviour and discipline. He would
approach
her
with
the
assistance
of
his   sisters ,  and
request her to be his patureishi. If the girl accepted the
proposal, the young man would be asked to swear that he
would   strictly adhere
to
the   stringent regulations that
must be
observed
in
that kind of relationship. If the
young
man   vowed
to observe the rules, there
was
an
exchange of ornaments and esongoyo,
an aromatic herb,
was
given
to
the   girl   by
the
young
man
Then
the
relationship was sealed:
The
news
of
the
sealed
relationship
was
circulated and
among the young people.
It also
reached their families and the young man's girlfriend and
the girl's boyfriend. It was made sure that there was no
good

rivalry whatsoever between the two sets of friendship. In
all cases, it was made clear that patureishi took priority
over the conventional
When a young man came to
visit his patureishi the girl made sure that she informed
her boyfriend who would then
his distance. And all
other people, young and old, respected the relationship.
The
patureishi
institution
was
meant
to
check
the
conduct   and
behaviour of the young people and
them disciplined
Parents of the young man would give
him a young bull to sell, to buy beads and ornaments for
his patureishi:
Later when the
relationship had matured,
would give him a ewe to give to the girl as a mark
of respect that would continue between them for the rest
of their lives. When the young man swore in the name of
his patureishi, the swearing would be taken as serious
and solemn, and he would not be expected to negate it
Woe to the young man if he reneged on that deal:
The patureishi would investigate the matter and if she
confirmed that her young man had engaged himself in
disgraceful act of misconduct;
such
as
molestation of
children; petty thievery, disrespect of women; O an act
of cowardice; she would act swiftly to shame him.
She
would remove all the beads ornaments that he had given
her and
them to the pastures where the calves were
grazing; She would look for a calf that belonged to his
mother and would
adorn its neck with the ornaments_
When the calves   streamed home in the evening, there

of the estranged and shamed patureishi! All the people
in that village and in all other villages would know that
he had been abandoned by his patureishi because of his
misbehaviour
and   indiscipline.
And
the
young
man
would have to run away
from home for sometime, to
escape the
burning shame.
In
a case like that; he would
have to work extra hard and for a
time to win back
the confidence of the girls and build his reputation anew_
But
young
man
who
balanced
his
two
relationships   appropriately
and  behaved
in  accordance
with the norms given by the culture of the Nasila people,
was accorded respect and regarded as
potential leader
and elder of the future of Maa_
"Let
me
be your patureishi if it really exists,"
Resian
said
jokingly:
"No
way;
Joseph
Parmuat
answered happily ""Since you
are my sister; you don't
qualify to be my patureishi.
"To speak   the  truth,
brother   Parmuat;
Resian
said seriously, "I have never heard of patureishi. Does it
really
exist?""It is
recent
casualty
of the  changing
trends in Nasila;
Joseph Parmuat said, his face-wrinkled
with concern  "Individualism, petty jealousy and lack of
trust killed that once important aspect of Nasila culture."
"Ibelieve culture and traditions are never static_
said Taiyo pointedly. "By being dynamic, culture shades
off   aspects
that
become
irrelevant
with
time.
Two
examples of such moribund aspects of culture are F.G.M
and the clan   system that  forces   people

These should have disappeared
at the turn of the last century. But

for the  sole purpose of
perpetuating their rule_
"Oh; myl I didn't know that you hold such strong
views
on
the
Nasila
culture,
Joseph
Parmuat
said
chuckling: "In any case, you cannot say OuT culture has
been static. It has already shed off many negative aspects
some of which were obnoxious, such as the tradition of
throwing the dead and the dying to the hyenas, or the
inhuman

"If one did that;
said Joseph Parmuat knotting
his
brows
to
show
the
seriousness
in
which
he
considered
the
matter;
"that
person
would

There are no two ways about it. But;
by the way, why is that there is always
scramble for
to marry in Nasila; to the extent that men are forced
to book unborn baby girls, and then
still have
to
wait for thirteen to fourteen years for them to mature?"
"It is simply because demand outstrips  supply,
Joseph
Parmuat   said  roaring with  laughter_
"You
see;
when
one
man
marries
seven
women,
he
deprives
another six of potential wives. It is that simple. Soon you
will
see   Nasila
men
coming to your father's home
to

"Not us! 
Taiyo and Resian said simultaneously.
"We shall never allow it!'
Taiyo added jokingly.
'But
why go fishing in shallow
waters while the blue sea is
teeming with fish? Advise Nasila men to go to Nakuru
and other towns where girls cost a shilling for a dozen of
them: There is an inordinate demand for men there_
Joseph Parmuat glanced
at her
enquiringly .
He
knew Taiyo had been trying to
a message across to
him all the time during that evening; but he deliberately
declined
to take the
cue
Any time   she  tried
to look
directly into his eyes,
he   slyly  averted his and  either
turned and looked at Resian or looked across the distant
plains and to the hill beyond
His elusiveness did not however deter Taiyo. She
had fallen in love with him and she knew without doubt
that he too had. The only
that stood between them
was the archaic Nasila culture.
And she did not give
girls

put

hoot
about
it.
She
therefore
did
not
feel
guilty
whatsoever
in  pursuing the
desire
of her
heart
The
apparent chasm that separated them did not matter to her_
Moreover, she told herself decidedly, if she visited him
in his house and convinced him that
belonged to
one another;
could always leave Nasila for another
destination
and
life
would
continue
without
the
bothersome Nasila culture.
Once she made up her mind, she set out to visit
him in his house in the evening of the following day. She
had never been to his house before, but he had pointed
out to
her   where
it
was
She
had
also
observed
his
routine. He would go to his house first after school to
change into evening clothes, before  coaching them
in
song and dance.
Joseph Parmuat's two roomed house was the first
one in
a row of blocks that had four such houses each_
When  she got to the door; she found it unlocked and
pushed the door open. She peeped in.
"Joseph, are you in?" she called and hesitated for
a moment before
walking into the
room: "Joseph;

stood silently observing a room she had not seen before_

There
was another table at the

with   four armchairs   around it. In

a   sideboard upon
which   several
framed   photographs
were
set:
Nearby;

a stove and
few spotlessly clean pots and
other utensils_
She thought the entire room was as tidy as
the most virtuous housewife could ever have wished to
find
Curiosity and
an
inquisitive impulse made her
slip
into
the
next
room;
that
was
Joseph
Parmuat's
bedroom.
That too, she found it neat and tidy.
His bed
was   wide and
was   neatly made.
It
was   covered in
an
exquisite blue bed cover  and
pillow
in
matching
colour pillow case,
at the headboard of the bed: The
wall behind the bed was lined with shelves neatly packed
with
books.
More
books
were
stacked

beside
the
bed.
Another
sideboard stood at the corner of the bedroom_
Upon its
shiny
surface,

Then   she picked the oly photograph that
was
different_
It
was
picture
of
tall_
handsome,
distinguished looking young man in
a black suit and tie
looking out upon the world with
quizzical amusement:
There was
a hint of humour about the eyes o the wide
face she had come to love_
She was still scrutinising the
picture
when the soft closing of the  door behind her
lay

made her jump. Joseph Parmuat stood with
surprised
look in his eyes.
SO

into

house,"
Taiyo said her
with its usually brown
complexion
becoming
ashamed
with
embarrassment
"It's okay;" Joseph Parmuat replied, an inscrutable smile
on
his face. "This is your brother's house and you are
welcome any time 
There was a
fleeting moment f silence that drew
her eyes to his face
He too lifted his eyes to hers, and
for the briefest of seconds, the two pairs of eyes met and
held:
"Ifelt

stopped, swamped in confusion
Then she added quietly;
"Iam sorry. I suppose [ really should not have come_
"Don't be ridiculous,
he said still smiling: He
dropped the
he had carried onto the bed.
"Ihave just
been to the shops to purchase a few items before coming
to your place.
There
was  another moment of silence in which
neither of them moved.
"Joseph;
she began eloquently.  "There is need
for uS to talk about us_

vehemently .

In silence she watched him as he took his velvet
jacket
behind the door and shrugged it onto his
shoulders_
"We may now go_
He turned abruptly from
her and began to walk quickly towards the door to the
living room:.
"Joseph!" The tone of her voice stopped him in
his tracks
He stood for a moment,
still, his back to
her; his hand
on the
door  handle, his wide shoulders
slightly and defensively hunched before he slowly turned
back to face her:
"Joseph;
she called again her eyes searching his
face. "Let
uS
not  pretend that the
two
of uS
are

"What are we going to do?" he asked his heart in
terrible agony from which; for that one moment he did
not attempt to shield
"It is for you I fear my dear lady.

when

"I

she shouted and lifted her chin
sharply, feeling the rise of such
conflict of emotion in
her heart, that for a moment she feared she might scream

She did not bother to hide them or to
brush them away.
Suddenly,  Joseph
Parmuat's   heart
was   touched
and he moved swiftly towards her:
single   step took
him to where she stood and he passionately took her into
his arms_
All control lost; she sobbed furiously, her body
shaking;
her
head
buried
in
his
shoulder.
His
arm
tightened about her while she felt his hand gentle in her
hair:
He
was
murmuring
soothing
words
that
through the storm of her emotions meant nothing:
The
only
that mattered and which she was aware of at
that moment was the feel of his body against hers; its
warmth and the brush of his
woolly hair
her
cheek   She could not move. She pressed so close to him
that she could hear the beating of his heart as if it were in
her own body.
"No, Joseph;
she said in an infantile whimper.
"I
cant bear that we
express the love that we have for
one   another because of some primitive culture. If by
loving you, I offend the sensibilities of Nasila then let
me offend them and face the consequences of
'doing so!
"I also love you; very   much;
Joseph Parmuat
responded finally:
"I loved you the moment I saw you

said petulantly her   words  agonised  "No way, never!"
She stopped,
confused
and  angry
with
herself
at her

outburst.
She took several
steadying
breaths and then said, "I cannot accept that a culture that

life.

At last they
drew
little   apart.
His   eyes
were
open, honest and steady upon her face.
"I have also made up my mind, here and then;'
he said with exhilaration. He closed his eyes, took a deep
slow breath and said with a trembling emotional voice. "I

ready to face any eventuality that may arise out
of our love for one another.
"Thank you;

to overflow
Her warm delicate fingers gripped his
firmly as she said excitedly; "I knew all

When
later   walked into the practice room
found Resian waiting for them; sitting as she always
did hunched up in a chair; her nose determinedly buried
in a book: If she detected anything strange with her sister
and their adopted brother; she did not show_
Taiyo
was   exhilarated beyond
words_
She
was
simply in
a seventh heaven
From the first day she saw
Joseph
Parmuat;
her
father's
homecoming
ceremony; she had fallen in love with him instantly. She
thought he was the incarnation, the very picture of her
dreams
She recalled the way it happened
She had been
standing there with her sister Resian; their eyes glued to
the handsome, arrogantly athletic morans who cut such a
dash; as
danced and shrieked boisterously. She was
greatly attracted by the way
moved to the centre of
the circle, and one by one O in pairs, jumped high up in
the
air
in  step
with
the   guttural   chants   of the
other
morans
as
heaved
their
chests
forwards
and
backwards excitedly. One moran in particular caught her
eye. He was
among the rest in that he was dark-
haired while the rest had smeared greasy red ochre into
their hair 
He was a tall lithe young man, who, when he
got his chance to jump, leapt higher and with more grace
than any of the others. She was immediately attracted to
him
and
her
gaze
henceforth
riveted
upon
him:
The attraction translated into love. And from that
she was besotted with that love.

unique
day;

Taiyo had
won
over  Joseph Parmuat or
so she
thought:
Ever
since
relocated
to
Nasila,
she
considered
herself
to
be
in
war
zone
against
the
debilitating Nasila culture. It was
a war of liberation of
the Nasila
woman 
She knew
there
were   many battle
fronts in

Other combatants had come
to fight
and all that was needed to
win
was   strong leadership:
She  thought
already
had

the
Minik

Nkoitoi
the Emakererei:
She was in one of the fronts 
How she burned with an ardent desire to join her one day:
She was their role model: She was their inspiration_
Taiyo knew that the
her secret love to Joseph
Parmuat
became
public
knowledge,
there
would
be
angry
reactions   from
the
elders
of
Nasila:
But
she
intended to defiantly stand her ground.
But if the heat
became   unbearable, she concluded,
could always
relocate to town and join what their mother;
the other
called people of an undefined culture,
or what the
Nasila people would call ilmeekure-kishulare.
Joseph Parmuat  felt differently _
When he
went
back to his house that evening after coaching the girls,
something
seemed
to
have   changed
dramatically.
He
recalled Taiyo's dazzling smile and the way her beauty
filled him with enchantment_
But the
enchanting feeling
seemed to have evaporated fast and in its place, his heart
was now filled with a
devastating feeling of hopelessness_
There
was
strange
emptiness
in
sort
of

day;
him;

hollowness he had
never experienced before.
His heart
was desolate like a deserted house.
He could not place the problem. He had won the
heart of the girl he ardently admired:
That should have
filled his heart with  exhilaration. Instead,
it was  filled
with a
frightening premonition.
Yes, he now knew.
He was like
fish that had
just jumped out of water in pursuit of one morsel, but
was nOw
finding itself unable to breath and was o the
verge of death: Yes, it had swallowed the morsel, but
what
was it to its body if it died? It
was
nOW
desperately trying to wriggle back into the
water.
Was
the morsel worth the risk the fish had taken and nearly
lost its dear life? The morsel was enticing, succulent and
luscious, but was it worth dying for? Other morsels that
did not require one to die
were available in the water
were equally succulent and luscious, although
may not be equally attractive and enticing: Did he have
to abandon Nasila culture in exchange of a woman who
sneered at its tenets? Was she one who could be tamed
or was she like
a wild donkey? Even if she could, how
would
he
ever
jump
the
hurdle
of
her
status
that
negatively
described
her
as
being
among
intoiye
nemengalana?
How about the
complication brought about by the
fact that she was
daughter of an Ilmolelian elder who
was
of Iloorasha-kineji like his own  father and  which
made her his own sister? How would he ever go round

for;
They

that? He considered running away from Nasila and its
culture but that left
a sour taste in his mouth: No, Nasila
culture
was too valuable to be abandoned. It gave him
values. It gave him his identity. It gave him the latitudes
within
which
to
check
his
excesses
and
warned
him
when he went out of its confines. Yes, Nasila culture was
the father and mother that brought up and nurtured its
children to maturity. Nasila culture was too valuable and
too important to be abandoned in exchange of a woman's
love
But was Taiyo just another woman? He searched
and  searched his heart   again:
At the end,
it
was
the
wisdom of Maa that prevailed.
Its   founder had said
man could never run away from his clan and his age-set.
He declined her love_

CHAPTER TEN
Apprehension set in the hearts of Ole Kaelo and
Mama Milanoi.
The awaited
was here; Oloisudori
was about to claim his prize. Since the
Oloisudori
left,
they
had   had
sleepless   nights_
They
turned
the
subject over and over; but
were yet to find
a way
out of the impending disaster:
Ole Kaelo had therefore
continued to bury his head in the sand like the proverbial
ostrich with
hope that time might provide
a solution.
He hoped against
that the Nasilian adage that said
bad days  receded while
approached,  would
come true
Although
had
decided
to
conceal
the
information regarding Oloisudori's evil intention, Resian
continued
to be apprehensive.
She had
premonition_
She had become hyper sensitive about her future and the
possibility of her enrolling
as
student at the Egerton
University.
Fear had crept into her life and
a small voice
seemed to warn her of impending danger. She wondered
at times whether she was hallucinating O she was seeing
faceless   persons   lurking
at every
dark
corner of their
house, especially at night. Before
went to bed, she
made sure she had double-checked the doors. Although
she was not superstitious, a recent incident where
bird
called
Olmultut came to
coo sorrowfully at their gate,
worried her. Joseph Parmuat had told them that when the

bird cooed sorrowfully, it was always a harbinger of bad
news. Its cry was always ominous_
It
was
different
with
Taiyo .
Her
mood
was
upbeat. Even her mother had noticed that in the last few
she had become extremely happy. She carried out
her housekeeping   duties
while  humming;  whistling
Or
singing loudly:
What
wonderful daughter she had
in
Taiyo,
her
mother   repeatedly   thought   happily,
while
observing the way she satisfactorily played her multiple
roles as first-born daughter of the Kaelo family, sister to
Resian, capable organiser in the home, ever present help
as a
housekeeper and a most cherished companion to her
mother
Her mother thought her daughters
new  found
happiness
was
welcome ray
of  sunshine in
home
where gloom; and despondency had become a hallmark:
After procrastinating for quite
some   time,
Ole
Kaelo
and
his   wife
decided to
seek help. Ole
Kaelo
would consult his friend and mentor; Ole
Supeyo, while
his
wife
would
consult
her   inkainito,
the
wives
of
Simiren;, Ole Kaelo's brother.
That morning's breakfast was taken in
a sombre
mood. Olarinkoi was the oly one who did not seem to
be preoccupied
His ubiquitous presence at every meal
had now been accepted by everyone

CHAPTER ELEVEN
Taiyo and Resian tearfully and eagerly waited for
the arrival of their parents. They burned to tell them of
the traumatizing incident:
also wanted to tell them
of Olarinkoi's unexpected arrival and his quick valorous
action which had rescued them from rape. Indeed, the
two
were humbled by Olarinkoi's bravery and concern
for their safety, especially when they recalled the way
had always ignored him and regarded him as
for nothing baggage.
Resian
impressed
upon
her
sister
to
use
that
incident to push their father to accept to let them go back
to Nakuru and enroll at the Egerton University. Although
the
incident
was   unfortunate,
she
reasoned,
it
could
convince him that Nasila was not
a safe place. It
was
teeming with wolves, hyenas and crazy vagabonds. Had
been raped, his worry now would be whether his
daughters had been  infected with the HIV  and
AIDS_
The fact that
were lucky that time round,
she told
her sister emphatically, did not mean the incident could
not recur with disastrous consequences. The alternative,
she
concluded in jest,
was   for their father
to
engage
Olarinkoi's services to

her into the bushes. She was determined
to take the first available opportunity to persuade their
father to let them
return
to Nakuru   and
enroll
at the
university:
After   all,
she reasoned, both
of them had
attained the required qualifications ad all
needed
was the enrolment at the
university and a sponsor:
Their parents looked tired, and aloof when
arrived
home.
Their   father   immediately   removed
his
shoes, slumped
into

at

unblinkingly:
Their
mother
went
straight
into
their
bedroom and did not come out. For reasons
did not

Olarinkoi   did
not
return
after that   afternoon's
incident.

The senior most
wife of Simiren, yeiyo-botorr, said Mama Milanoi might
be surprised to find the girls asking to be circumcised

mother's   mood was   completely different.
Her previous
night's taciturnity had turned into loquacity:
When their father later turned up for breakfast, he
was
edgy and his eyes were shifty. It was oly when
told him what had befallen them the previous
that he
was   shocked back to his
senses.  He
got agitated and
angrily gnashed his teeth
He hit the table
with his
clenched fist; rattling the crockery o it: He shouted in
thunderous   booming
voice   saying
an
assault

his
daughters was not oly an affront to him personally that
he could not tolerate but
a threat to the
security of his
children

With their mother
promising that in their absence she would try to convince
their father to allow them
to
go back
to Nakuru and
enroll as students at the Egerton University, she nipped
in the bud any opposition that Resian might have raised.
She told them she wanted them to move into their uncle
Simiren's home and live with them for sometime s0 that
could get to know them  well;
as
well as to know
other   people
who
lived
in
the

She
repeatedly assured them that there was nothing sinister in
the   offing:

atmosphere that
left behind in their home and for
that
were
appreciative.
Seeing
the
hearty
welcome,
the
girls
wholeheartedly plunged into that life with adventure in
their hearts_
With renewed interests and fresh
feeling of
affinity,
observed the life at Simiren's home_
Life   and
work
in
that
home
was
communal:
Although
each  mother had her house and cooked her
own food,
all grown up daughters helped each
one of
them, to bring in water, firewood, and assisted in the
actual cooking  Those mothers
who were
incapacitated
by pregnancy, as two of them were at that time, received
most help as the grown-up daughters were posted to their
houses nearly permanently.
The
most
senior  mother  of
the   house, yeiyo-
botorr, could be said to have had patriarchal authority
that neared that of Simiren, because she deputised him in
the
home.
Whereas
Simiren
took
care
of
weightier
matters of the family such as the animal husbandry, trade
and
the
sources
of food,
yeiyo-botorr
took
off
his
shoulders all matters of administration in the homestead.
Hardly
were
there
any   disagreements
on
that
front
When   disputes arose
were
speedily ad amicably
settled:
The  girls
were housed by yeiyo-kiti

She
was   modern,
judging by the standard of that home. They also found
her amicable, kind-hearted and understanding: It was
joy staying in her house.
It did not take
before Taiyo and Resian
used to the tempo of life in their uncle's home. Within
that short period,
had learnt quite a lot:
could
now tell how easy it was to stereotype the Nasila culture
by highlighting the negative aspects while ignoring the
positive
ones_
In their uncle's home,
learnt basic
truths of Nasila culture and the
to
life that
would have never been taught by anybody anywhere.
They learnt with
a lot of interest and excitement
that to be able to fit into their uncle's home, one had to
be selfless. That was inevitably so because in that home,
everything
was
shared:

"So would I" Taiyo said. "We hope to join her

walked down to

She could still see in her mind

from
a clear blue sky.
She had then admired the white
overcoats that the handlers wore.

looking at the two

three or four green-breasted birds called ilkasero flashed
through the air and perched in
a bush further back in the
trees_
Then they fluttered their wings rapidly and flared
away fiom the bush_
Ole Kaelo turned his head slightly
and looked absently at the bush:

Ole Kaelo too, slapped

the two brutes had visited upon his daughters.
It
was
during   the   interrogation
that
queer
revelation surfaced.
One of the vagabonds, although he
was of Ilukumae clan; was related to Taiyo and Resian:
Ntara
Muyo
was   their first
cousin.
He
was
son   of
Mama   Milanoi's   sister
who
was   married
to
Muyo,
an
elder of Ilukumae_
On learning that; Joseph Parmuat was
most embarrassed. Although he was of Ilmolelian clan of
Iloorasha-Kineji sub clan he was not as closely related
to the girls as that
vagabond
was . Ole Kaelo too
was
flabbergasted.

was, however, grateful that

was
planned and the Ilukumae clan were to compensate Ole

That

But
Oloisudori's   impending
visit
continued
to
gnaw at them
The mere thought of the visit brought
nasty twinge of conscience in his heart_
What Oloisudori
saw
in
their   daughter
Resian 
he   simply   could
not
understand.
Truly even as
father, he could see that his
daughter's   body
was
blossoming like the body of any
other girl at her age but;, he thought there was nothing
spectacular in her body that was so much at odds with
her plain and unremarkable face. He had to admit that if

for
his
reputation
and
the
age   factor;
Oloisudori would have been the perfect match for that
sullen
and
hardheaded
daughter
of
his.
After
all
Oloisudori was not just any other suitor: He was
a man
of substance and
a man of property _
Ole Kaelo began to
warm up to the idea that Oloisudori could, after all, be a
son-in-law.
Where
else
would
he
ever
get
such
business offer as the one Oloisudori had offered
and
for what a
price? When all but one road was closed to

narrow
that
one road
was,
the
protagonist had to squeeze through it especially if that
road was
a matter of life and death:
To lose his business
premises, lose all those stocks and possibly lose his only
dwelling;
was
to him
a   matter of life and
death:
To
survive, he realised with finality he had to change his
attitude towards Oloisudori; he had to embrace him
He
began to rationalize all matters pertaining to
Oloisudori.
He thought of the disquieting matter of his
reputation. He thought it was all hearsay; probably vague
gossip
or pure nonsense.
He concluded that those lies
about Oloisudori were
being bandied about by enemies
of his development
The six wives the man was said to
be married to,
were   daughters of men like him:
There
was therefore, nothing wrong with his daughter being the
wife
of
Oloisudori.
Who
else
could
have
made
it
possible for him to sign those lucrative contracts other
than Oloisudori who, as it now transpired, did it purely

even
with
all
those   pleasurable
convictions, the mention of Oloisudori's name brought a

Once   convinced,
Ole Kaelo also persuaded his
wife that all what remained for them to do was find an
agreeable
and
amicable

of   handing
Resian

The return of Taiyo and Resian brought back life

Ilukumae man called Muyo.

new deadly battle fronts would be opened. For one, the

truce
that
had
been
established

flare
up   afresh:

He

and
he
specifically wanted Resian to cook for them:
The message
sent
into the hearts   of Ole
Kaelo and his wife. They had been dilly dallying for
time unable to find the best way to approach Resian
and break the news to her:
At last, their procrastination
had caught up with them:
Taiyo and Resian had been to the practice room
where Joseph Parmuat had been coaching Taiyo in song
and dance. Resian had
sat reading:

Resian
sauntered
into
the
room
where
her   parents
sat   in
the   overstuffed
armchairs set in the corner near
a warm charcoal brazier:
Her father was reading an old newspaper which he set
aside when she entered.
"Ne-yeiyo-ai nanyorr

answered
apprehensively. She pushed her hands into the pockets of
her skirt and hunched her shoulders defensively. As
as she could remember; her father had never taken the
slightest interest in anything she had said o done, except
to criticise 0r rebuke her:
That conversation was making
her suspicious and uneasy.

Resian sheepishly, too embarrassed at being the focus of
attention:  Absent-mindedly she added,  "Tomorrow

"Yes, Oloisudori is coming for lunch;

said evenly as if to show there was nothing special about
him;
was  going to ask Taiyo to
and help your
mother,
but it seems as if you had impressed Oloisudori
so much the last time he was here, that he particularly
asked that you be here to receive him and his party.
It is
to be impressive, isn't it, eh?"
Resian
did
not  respond.
The
moment
of
appalled silence was so dense that it was suffocating: It
was
ominously pregnant and Resian was amazed to see
her mother sit quietly as if nothing was happening:
"Must
be
there,
Papaai?"
Resian
asked
desperately. "Surely, Yeiyo can manage o her own. Isn't
it Yeiyo?
"You

her

thundered with finality. "It is important to me that you be

His voice
was cold as he added acidly. "What kind of a wife will

don't take time

"Papaai, siake,

a last attempt to plead
to her father's inner feelings.

and then plunged headlong "I can't just stand Oloisudori.

he forcefully hit his
open   left palm; his  eyes

But right
inside his heart
he knew his anger
was   coupled
with
something else
It had some edge of
on his part: It
was
also
bewildering
and
frightening:
Even
more
frightening was to hear her call Oloisudori
a monster: It
was simply dreadfull
As
she   hurriedly left the
room, Resian
staggered and caught her foot under the leg of
a chair
Her  father's lips tightened and he glared
at her saying
nothing   Blindly,
she   walked
out into
the

through the front door; down the steps, and right to the

painfully between her teeth:
Why; in God's name, she
asked herself, did Oloisudori have to insist that she must
be there  when he and his friends ate their lunch? She
shook her head fiercely. She could not do it, she would
not do it, she declared 
She walked to an oloponi tree at the centre of the
garden Finding

her shoulders drooping; her knees drawn to her breasts
and her
arms   folded upon them  She sat so for
time, shivering in the
gnawing  cold, staring
into the
darkness. In a helpless gesture of unhappiness she bowed
her head, resting her forehead on her arms, and went into
serious reflection on what her father was
forcing her to
do.
She did not believe him when he said Oloisudori
had chosen her over Taiyo, to prepare lunch
him. She
did not believe that
She knew her  father  despised her
ever
since
she
was
young:
She
wondered
what
he
disliked so much about her_
Was it her fault? Her father
would
never
provoke
Taiyo
the
way
he
constantly
provoked her:
He would never rebuke, scold o ridicule
Taiyo the way he repeatedly did it to her: She thought he

She wondered why he was still insistent that she must be
there, even after giving her reasons_
It
was   Taiyo who
went to

here?"
she
rebuked
her   sternly
when
she
found

hunched up in the dark. "It is so cold out here. Look at
you; you are shivering!
"Iwas about to come in,
Resian said demurely.
"Stupid thingl '
Taiyo snapped  "Imagine coming
out here   without

Honestly, Resian, havent
you the  slightest common  sense? Come
on
now, let's
They went into the house and Resian angrily told
her  sister,
about her father's demand. Taiyo, however;
thought her sister was
frivolous. Although she had
always
known
that   their
father
disliked   Resian,
she
thought she was now giving him reason to hate her even
more.
And
truly;
she had
seen
that   their   father
was
growing
more
and
more
disappointed
with
her _
His
continued
reprimand
to
Resian
had
become
very
embarrassing to
as he kept on giving her
as
an
example of
a well behaved and well disciplined girl to
the chagrin of Resian. Even their mother had said several
times that Taiyo was
a paragon of virtue;
a true model of
Maa feminine decorum: And that was because she hardly
ever talked to her father unless he spoke to her; and then
only

being

question he had asked her _
Their mother thought Taiyo
had learnt from her not to question things
or ask why
were done one way and not the other; unless it was
really her business to do so
And because of Taiyo's behaviour which their
father   perceived
to
be   exemplary,
he
never
lost
an
opportunity to impress upon Resian; to emulate her sister_
However, the comparison had always upset Resian and
remained
a constant reminder of her perceived failures_
Obviously, she could not have known how disillusioned
her father had been right from the day she was born: Had
she
known
how
deeply   the
misfortune
of having
daughter rather than the son her father had wanted had
hurt him, she could have probably reacted differently to
his constant and unceasing rebuke and ridicule.
Resian
blamed
her   father   for  the  tension
that
continued
to grip their home
ever  since
came to
Nasila:
And she did not hide that fact from their mother.
She blamed the new development o what she called
newborn mongrel; a new culture that was partly Maa and
partly
a combination of a myriads of cultures found in
Nakuru town_
And that was the animal he had introduced
into his home in Nasila which
was   nOW
threatening to
devour her first and thereafter everyone else, one by one.
When
recently stayed in their uncle's home,
she had come face to face with some of the best tenets of
Nasila culture that was also the Maa culture.
She found
out that the girl child was always protected and shielded
they
they
they

from males who ogled and stared
at them with not so
intentions
Whenever there
were male visitors in
the home the girls were shepherded away, into one of the
aunts houses_
And their aunts   served the visitors.  The
only came out after the guests had gone.
Some of
the elders,
were   courteous   enough
to ask; before
entered
house, whether  there
were   children in there_
And in Maa, the term children always referred to girls. If
were in, elders would either move to another house
or
if
must enter; the mother of the girls would tell
her daughters to move to oe of her aunts' houses and in
such
a case, the elders would politely stand outside the
house until the
had left: During their stay in their
uncle's home,
hardly came face to face with him_
There was hardly any interaction between the fathers and
their daughters.
And the fathers  jealously guarded the
privacy of their daughters and ensured their security.
It took a lot of persuasion to have Resian agree to
serve Oloisudori and his friends the following day. And
she was oly convinced when she was told her father's
business depended on her decision
By morning; stubborn Resian had gotten her way.
She had demanded that her sister Taiyo also be enlisted
among those who would serve the distinguished guests.
When her mother resisted, saying the guest's wish should
be respected, Resian had put up
spirited fight, arguing
that it was wrong for them as
family to allow a visitor;
whoever
he
was;
to
dictate
as
to
who   amongst
the
good
girls

they
they
girls

members of the family should attend to him. She rejected
Taiyo's argument that since
had promised Yeiyo-kiti
that
would go and help her plaster her kitchen, she
would better be there to represent her_
Resian said their
Yeiyo-kiti would surely understand if
told her
were
serving her father's guests.
In lowered tones, she
had told Taiyo. she needed her presence to fortify her
spirit for Oloisudori terrified her.
It
was   after their mother consulted their father
that it
was   settled:
Taiyo
was
to assist
in
serving the
visitors alongside her sister Resian:
Taiyo
found
her
sister's
fear
of
Oloisudori's
presence justified.
He arrived
in

vehicles_
Behind the four vehicles   trailed

was covered in a tarpaulin:
At the back left of each of the
four vehicles sat a man of stature.
Taiyo and Resian  craned their necks

glittered as he stooped to carefully open the door of the
limousine.

And when his three friends alighted, Taiyo and
Resian   shuddered
at their sight.
Even  Taiyo who

Only one of the men had an extra adornment:

Resian's   words in

were prophetic, Taiyo
thought; not only did she dislike Oloisudori the moment
he walked through the door to their house, but she also
immensely hated the pomposity that he and his friends
displayed. The tall,
muscular and distinguished looking
Oloisudori,
was indeed exactly as Resian had described
him:
He
was bad mannered, discourteous and certainly
overbearing  With sure feminine instincts, Taiyo sensed
that the man's mission in their home
was more than
business excursion:
She was alarmed, even fearful when it dawned on
her that the evil
looking man was possibly targeting her
sister Resian; and hence his demand that she be there to
serve him on that day. His pretentious warmth and charm
as he greeted them;
was
nothing but
an  empty facade,
she
concluded.

Oloisudori's friends were loquacious, especially after the
fifth bottle of hot spirits was emptied
When the party broke up at three in the afternoon;
amidst warm
appreciation from the friends of Oloisudori;
Ole Kaelo was all smiles_
He
thought he had been rated a
worthy  companion of the likes of Oloisudori:
had
'arrived' .
And   when Oloisudori asked his  friends
what
thought of the girl, it was thumbs up by all the three.
"She is the catch of the year;" they declared.
Later in the evening after Taiyo and Resian had
cleared the table,
washed
all  utensils  and cleaned
the
kitchen, Taiyo came back to the living room. She found
her father sitting alone enjoying
last glass of the hot
drink the visitors had been drinking:
He
was
reading a
newspaper; his reading glasses perched upon the tip of

his nose.
On hearing his daughter enter; he looked up,
pushed back the reading glasses and briefly stared at her.
Taiyo was careful in the way she approached her father
for she knew he was edgy and sensitive. She, however,
wanted to find out from
him
what he thought of the
luncheon and in the process see whether she would
hint on what it was all about.
The body language of the
four men and the lavish gifts
gave had disturbed her
and
got
her   suspicious__
She
had
lot
of
trust
and
confidence in her  father; but  she  feared unscrupulous
people like Oloisudori could, like Joseph Parmuat had
told them; lead him into
a   murky alley and then turn
round to extort the impossible from him.
"I
came
to
see
whether   you
are
comfortable,
Papaai,
said pleasantly_
"Yes, indeed,

he answered and nodded
little absently. "I am comfortable, my dear child.
"It

she
asked as she plumped up a cushion on a sofa.
"And
Resian
and
I did everything you
expected uS to do to make the visitors comfortable and
happy.
"Indeed you did everything;'
he said curtly. "Yes,
I must say the visitors were
happy:

"Most certainly he is_
"Did

she
continued and rued it immediately for she noticed he was
getting irritated.
"Yes, but why do you ask?" he snapped showing
signs of a rising temper:
"Nothing;

quickly
trying to
avert
an
oncoming clash:

glass, tipped and  drained off its content
in

Taiyo hesitated. Now that she had failed to

and their mother as
argued about something:

saw her father turn his head and cock it to that direction,
listening:
She knew she had lost his   attention:

"I

and noting
that her father's thoughts were no longer with her; gave

she felt

with eager expectation.
"If [

her  father began in

"You are

Resian answered
eyeing him curiously. His face was unusually kind. His
eyes
held hers
as
he   smiled
broadly.
'That's

she
thought triumphantly. 'That must be it!'
"You and

asked  sensationally, thinking she

But

quickly:  "Who between them spoke to you about OUI

asked

"Both Yeiyo and

themselves.   "Never mind what

The sound ofhis tone carried a definite finality:

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Ole
Kaelo's
visit
to
Oloisudori's  home  greatly
changed him:
He felt rejuvenated like
man who had
just
returned
from
the
mountain
where
he
had
inhaled the thin, fresh and invigorating mountain air: The
scales, it seemed, had fallen from his eyes and suddenly
he was able to see what he had failed to see all the years
he was
working in Nakuru
Oloisudori had invited him and his wife to visit
one
of
his
Six
homes
ostensibly
as
gesture
of
appreciation for the hospitality he had accorded him and
his friends when
visited his home. However; he had
wanted them to see and appreciate in the proximity ofhis
kingdom  During the visit;
he had hoped
would
savour the pleasures and the kind of life their daughter
Resian was going to enjoy. He
was sure if
had
glimpse of the palatial home that was nearing completion
and
which
he
had
particularly
built   for
Resian 
his
struggles to entice and lure her to accept to move in and
live with him would come to an end
He was sure
would immediately take
over
the
struggle to persuade
her to agree to marry him:
Ole
Kaelo
had
felt
greatly
flattered
when
Oloisudori compared Resian with the legendary beautiful
brown girl who dominated the songs of four generations
of morans in the past
years. Her beauty had set new
standards
upon
which
the
Maa   beauty   queens
were

judged, and were up to then still appreciated The legend
described
the girl as
So
charmingly beautiful
that she
caused the morans to traverse the vast;
and hot plains
of Susua all the way to Mosiro, where the girl lived with
her parents, just to have
glimpse of her beauty. It was
said that the morans on seeing her; would stand in
daze
staring fixedly at her:
would drink in the subtlety
of her   beauty:
her   baby   face
with
those   bewitching
dimples on her cheeks, her white pearl-like teeth planted
on black gums, and that captivating natural gap called
enchilaloi
that   prettily
sat   conspicuously between
her
upper front teeth: She was said to be petite, had a narrow
waist and
shapely
Her
languorous eyes
were said to sap energy from the knees of those to whom
she directed her glance, incapacitating them at once. All
those besotted with her love could not help but sing in
unison:
Entito nanyokie naitudungo
Brown
girl
who
caused
Ilmurran Susua
Morans to traverse Susua
Oloisudori thought Resian was like that girl and
more. She was also like the famous English lady whose
love besotted
great legendary gentleman called Lord
Ngata.
In fact,  Oloisudori thought he and Lord Ngata

When
the   two   of  them
settled
on
what
wanted
to
do,
Oloisudori   thought  pleasantly, nothing
would hold them back: The great settler went to England,
met a lady and fell in love with her so much
he was
prepared to bring heaven down to
earth
to please her_
Similarly,
when
Oloisudori
went
to
Nasila
and
met
Resian, he thought he felt what the legendary settler felt:
Like him; he was also ready to undertake everything to
have her installed in his palatial home as his wife. His
only hope was that the chivalry he felt was not going to
end
up
in   disappointment like
it happened
with Lord
Ngata. It was said after building
stately castle for his
beloved bride to be, the lady was said to have come the
whole way from England, looked askance at the majestic
castle, turned and looked another way, never to look at it
From then on, the love of the Lord to the much
admired
and
esteemed   lady
was
unrequited
and
that
pained him
deal:
And that had triggered such
virulent
hatred
for
women
in
the
heart
of
the
old
gentleman; that for the rest of his life, he never allowed a
woman to come anywhere near him_
To avoid that kind of disappointment and great
pain; Oloisudori thought he would beautify the palatial
home that he was building for Resian s0 much that on
seeing it, she would have no option but to fall in love
with it
And when he had had her as his wife, he would
do
everything possible to win her love. Even when Ole
Kaelo had told him that his daughter yearned to go to the
they
that;
again
great

university to study, he had said he would readily consent
to the request and would let her enroll as
student as
soon as she settled.
The oly little delay anticipated, he
had thought  triumphantly,
was the period required for
her to undergo the little ritual of removing her from the
list of intoiye nemengalana,
process that he thought
would
hardly
take
more
than
three
months.
How
wonderful it would be; he mused delightfully, to have
graduate among his wives_
It was certainly
going to be
an added feather to his cap.
How unfortunate it was that he did not have his
daughters
with
him
when
he
and
his
wife
visited
Oloisudori? Ole Kaelo reminisced as he sat in his living
room
musing quietly. Had
been with them and had
seen
what
he
and
his
wife
saw
during
that
conducted tour, the story would have been different:
He imagined his stubborn daughter Resian would
by now be thanking her God for creating her
a woman
and endowing her with the kind of beauty that would
enchant a
wealthy man like Oloisudori And it was only
stupid
woman;
like
his
daughter
Resian
would
probably be, who would turn down the offer to own the
riches
saw in Oloisudori's home_
It
was true, he thought as he recalled
what his
grandfather used to say, oly
a woman went to bed poor
and woke up
stinking rich the following morning:
Even
his beloved daughter; Taiyo, could also be lucky soon_
Did Oloisudori not say on that first
when he visited

them that he had

in
Taiyo? He hoped he would come soon and he would be
like Oloisudori,
who would quietly hand over to him
briefcase stuffed with notes worth
a cool half a million
shillings  without as
much as
glance  or
mention of
what he had given_
He reclined o his sofa and allowed his mind to
enjoy the pleasures of reminiscence. And with a smile on
his lips, he travelled back with Oloisudori to his palatial
home in Naivasha:
had
sat on the back seat
in the imposing
vehicle,
while
his
wife
had

to
the
driver_
Bodyguards   rode the
vehicles   closely behind them_
It
was not until

came to know who Oloisudori was_

They were in
a cluster of red-tiled houses whose
tall outer walls painted in brilliant white, surrounded one
large  two-storied   building that
was
also of the
same
colour:
few metres from the fence that enclosed the
homestead, was the expansive Lake Naivasha and across
it was
a scenic sight of hills and
a forest that covered
them:
As he watched the hippopotamuses  frolicking in
the lake   water; Ole Kaelo thought of the  grandeur of
nature . He could not
but chuckle a little, amused by
the fact that,  Oloisudori and the hippopotamuses
were
two different kinds of animals that nature had brought to
live side by side, each minding its own business
The house
was awesome
Kaelo had more than
once  made to nudge his  wife
when   she   stood by the
windy corridors of the magnificent house, mesmerized at
the elegant and luxurious rooms that
open wide ready

gazed
with amazement at the expensively built double-storied
house
whose
windows   glinted
in
the   afternoon
sunshine. In the leafy neighbourhood were other equally
imposing and lofty mansions and apartments where the
rich businessmen and women lived alongside the senior
executives of large organisations
When
a servant
opened the front door for them
and Oloisudori ushered them in,
were
greeted by
large   beautiful
chandelier  that  gleamed brightly as it
dangled
above
their
heads
in
the
room
that
was
obviously going to be the

Oloisudori

which
was
going to
serve as the master bedroom:

together
at   the  poolside,
their  thoughts   drifting  into

were both thinking of Resian.
Looking at the distant hills to the west which was
the direction of Nasila, Ole Kaelo stood there musing
silently. He then made one decision: he was not going to
allow his daughter's ignorance to destroy her future_
As a
father; he declared, he had a God given
to
her
to a secure future; to lead her to the honey pot that would
be part of her future.
Whatever happened Resian was to
be married to Oloisudori:
Before
parted, Oloisudori took them
to
restaurant in town for another cup of tea_
It was then that
an
idea
on
how
to
deal
with
Resian
was
hatched.
Oloisudori was to come on the
appointed day ad time.
Ole
Kaelo
would
have   prepared
the   ground
SO
that
Oloisudori  would find Resian alone_
Oloisudori  would
then   persuade
her
to
accept
his   marriage   proposal,
without   alarming her:
If   she
was
agreeable,
well and
In that scenario, the rest of the plans would take
their natural course. If she declined, he would leave it at
that until the evening when his men would pounce on her
and abduct her: They would then drive her straight to the
house
prepared for her in Nakuru.
The three of them, Oloisudori, Ole Kaelo and his
wife roared with rich laughter when Ole Kaelo equated
the scenario to that of a goats kid that stubbornly refused
to
suckle
after
it
was   born:
Its

between
his  knees  and  forcefully
open  its  mouth and
tuck its mother's teat into it.
He would then squeeze out
the milk into the
kid's   mouth:
The
taste  of
the
milk
would make it suckle and removal of the teat from its
mouth would be a struggle.
"So

Resian 
Ole
Kaelo
concluded
triumphantly. "When she sees what you have laid out for
her
pleasures,
she
would
rebuke
herself
for
her
procrastination in the first place.
To cap it all, Oloisudori had given Ole Kaelo and
his wife his four-wheel-drive and
driver to take them
back to Nasila.
Mama Milanoi sat in her corner of the
back seat appreciating with awe the leather upholstered
interior of the vehicle She then turned her head to look
out of the window, her mind and her heart in a turmoil:
Although she had laughed with her husband and
with Oloisudori, the plan to ensnare her daughter like an
antelope left a feeling of betrayal in her heart: Truly, the
riches were in plenty, she argued to herself, but should
not Resian be persuaded to accept them rather than
being
ensnared into them? The idea of ensnaring her daughter
in a web like a spider did with a fly, did not appeal to her
at all:
It was different for her husband.
He felt on

immaculate vehicle.

It
was a
feeling of satisfaction and achievement:

the streets of Nakuru town and driven out into the flat
wooded   countryside   past
the
of
the
Egerton
University where their daughter Resian yearned to go. A
strange   pang of sadness   twisted the
nerves
of
Mama
Milanoi's heart. How sad it was, she thought hopelessly;
that
Resian
would
miss
to join   that
institution
that
seemed to have occupied her mind so relentlessly.
Ole
Kaelo also noticed the
of the university and
he
recalled angrily his daughter talking foolishly of wanting
to join the institution: It was that kind of frivolous talk;
he thought nonchalantly, 'that made him dislike Resian
with a
passion
Tossing the thought aside, he looked askance at a
group of untidy peasants who walked by the roadside,
leading
their   heavy
laden
donkeys.
Some
of
them
stopped momentarily to stare at the stately vehicle as it
past them while

the other; the heavy loads
carried. He disdainfully
looked the other  way:

Instead he looked at the

passed, barking furiously and chasing the wheels of
the strange awesome vehicle.
And later when
got to the Nasila plains the
road was rough and rutted. Even the powerful machine
slowed
down:
There
were
few   other
vehicles
on
the
dusty road,
and as
were tossed up and down; Ole
Kaelo   questioned
the   wisdom of his
own
decision
to
move to Nasila in the first instance. He began to admire
the luxurious life of the likes of Oloisudori; the urbanite_

was about to hand

guilty,
especially
when
he
recalled
the
atrocities
that
were
known to have been committed by Oloisudori over the
years_
But another  voice told him quietly that he was
being   foolish
and
unreasonable
to
question
his
own
conscience over the matter of Oloisudori; for he was just
one among many who were enjoying the fiuits of their
labour:
And it was hardly anybody's business to know
how honest that labour
was
After all_
the small voice
reassured him tauntingly, those who committed bigger
crimes such as
Goldenberg ad Anglo-leasing; were still
enjoying the 'fruits of their labour:
Had
not invested
the yields of their ill-gotten money in housing estates, in
shares, in import and exports in tourism; in transport and
in other trades, just as Oloisudori had done?
When
he
went
to
bed
later
that
evening;
he
remained
awake for many hours pondering over those
they
they
they
felt
they

disturbing thoughts that went through his mind fleetingly,
like water that churned violently in
turbulent sea.
He
thought of Oloisudori's impending visit and his intended
marriage to Resian. He knew the success Or failure of the
event would determine the fate of his business. Even his
continued   ownership of that house
where
he  and
his
family lived, depended
on
the
outcome of that event_
Should Oloisudori fail to get Resian and recall the loan
he had extended to him to
that house, he was done_
And
knowing Oloisudori, he could very easily draw the
rug from beneath his feet; leaving him vulnerable to all
kinds of vagaries And the thoughts gave him anxious
moments_
At dawn
when   sleep overtook him;
Ole Kaelo
had
pleasant
dream:
Resian
had
consented
to
Oloisudori's proposal.
After Oloisudori reported that to
him, he was greatly pleased and relieved
His wife was
rapturous. Although they were astonished at the turn of
events,
were relieved to know that
would not
have to live with the
of having forced their daughter
to
married.
What
a wise child his once hardheaded
daughter had turned to be after alll
And how devious!
After   all those  years   of sullenness,
awkwardness   and
tactlessness, she had finally brought relief to their life
and ushered
in
period of peace and tranquility. But
then; it was just that.
A dream!
As the parents pondered over the dream that had
given
them
false   hope,
their
daughters
were
busy

hatching their own little plan in their bedroom: They had
been observing their parents, especially their father; ever
since the arrival of Oloisudori and they were convinced
that there was something fishy going on.
Resian came up with
a two-
pronged plan:
would   find
carton
and
into it
all
those   gifts
Oloisudori had given them_
would then find a piece
of beautiful wrapping paper and smartly wrap the carton
and address it to Oloisudori as
reciprocal gift from the
daughters of Ole Kaelo.
When Oloisudori came to their
home next time, Resian said she would personally hand
the
to him and ensure that it was safely deposited in
his imposing vehicle. Once the gift was in his vehicle,
she would then  pretend to be docile and give him the
impression that she could
be
manipulated 
She
would
agree to go
with
allowing him to lead her
until she knew the direction of his thoughts_
Once she
to know his intentions, she would decisively react_
Woe to him if he thought she was a chattel to be secured

Oloisudori  would have
Resian the daughter of Ole Kaelo to reckon with! And
hoped
that
when
Oloisudori
back
to
his
destination and ripped open the carton
he would find all
those gifts he brought them sitting there prettily, staring
back at him. That would serve him right!
It did not take
before Taiyo and Resian had
their chance to
into practice their plan. It was a little
conspiratorial

behind their parents' backs. The mission was intended to
show Oloisudori that
were not on sale.
And if he
thought
the   prize   of
one
of  them
was
equivalent
to
whatever
amount
of
money
was
in
the
briefcase
previously handed to their father, he was mistaken.
They also
wanted
to show him
that
were

women
who had their
own
pride, self
respect and self esteem_
wanted him to know that
were
not
rudderless
objects   drifting   in

without

They
already
had
their
aims
and
projections
that   could   only
be  enhanced by
the   lofty
ideas
held and the desire for higher learning at the
university and
career development.
It was therefore
an
insult to their
intelligence, dignity and integrity to think
that mere material
such
as the gifts he lavishly
gave  them would sway them from the
had
already set for themselves
"Since
he
seems
to target
me
in his
demonic
designs,'
Resian said determinedly, "I shall try to face
him bravely and tell him what
think of him, especially
if he shows me his ill manners _
"Well,
I don't know whether I would be able to
face him alone,"
Taiyo said apprehensively. "He looked
rapacious and I can't trust him if we are left alone with
him in a room:
"The man is
a monster:
I fear him too;'
Resian
said balefully. "It is oly the desire to right things that

gives me courage to face him: To speak the truth; when I
think of the monster; I squirm in my shoes with fear!
"What   you
should

Taiyo told her sister emphatically, "is to be left alone in
the house with the monster. However brave you are, you
cannot be locked with
a boa-constrictor in
a room and
expect to survive.
"That I know, Taiyo-e-yeiyo;
Resian answered
timidly.
"I would oly accept to be in the living room

cant take that risk:
Little did the girls know that their parents and
Oloisudori had also hatched
their  plan:
So
when
Ole
Kaelo discussed with his wife Oloisudori's
and time
of arrival, he was apprehensive. Knowing how stubbom
Resian was, he was not sure
would lure her and
make her accept to
be  with
Oloisudori in their living
room
It had, been agreed that Oloisudori would arrive
the following
at ten 0'clock in the morning
After the visit was made known to the girls, and
it was
suggested that Resian
was
to receive and  serve
him with coffee, the parents
were
most
surprised that
Resian accepted the proposal without a fight. Ole Kaelo
wondered whether the dream he had had was coming to
pass
He hoped the rest of their plan would be as smooth
and
that
Resian
would
accept
Oloisudori's   proposal
without much ado. They had decided that Taiyo would
be sent to their uncle's home to help their yeiyo-botorr:
yeiyo

day

He himself would
be
at the shop while Resian  would
remain with her mother at home to wait for Oloisudori:
The plan also suited the girls. They had already
packed Oloisudori
in
decorated  carton that was
nOW
awaiting delivery to the owner:
When
Resian
appeared
for
breakfast
the
following
morning;
her   parents
were
astonished
Her
father suppressed an alarming premonition that suddenly
nagged his old heart:
Her mother stared at her daughter

to keep
silent and  watched  with
amazement the transformation
of their usually sullen daughter into
cheerful and jovial
child
But   what   amazed   them
most
was   the apparent
preparation she had made for that morning:
She was clad in her maroon taffeta dress whose
stark  neckline
was   softened
by
cream
and
maroon
silken  scarf that fluttered about her neck:
Her usually
braided hair had been  carefully made and piled softly
upon her head.
Her
golden colour earrings glinted in the

the
graceful length of her neck
She carried in her hand

"Sasa

visitor;"
Resian said cheerfully addressing her mother.
"How do you like my dress?"
"Splendid,
her mother answered cautiously _
little Resian-e-yeiyo, how lovely you look!"
her father who was uncharacteristically emotional said.
"You almost look like
grown up lady.
What do you
think, Olarinkoi?"
Olarinkoi who was present that morning looked
up at Resian, grunted and snorted
then grinned in
grudging admiration:
"Not bad;
he said looking at Resian sheepishly:
"Not bad at all_
Oloisudori
was   time conscious_
In
the kind of
business
that he
had   done
in
the   larger
of his
working life, time was of the essence. As a gangster; he
had
to
be   punctual,  precise  and  punctilious.
small
inexactness 0r careless disregard of the plan could
not oly result in missed opportunities but, could also
prove to be fatal. Punctuality had therefore become his
second nature_
That was how he approached Resian's issue. Like
all other tasks that he undertook; he approached it with
singleness of mind.
He planned meticulously, putting
precise time frame to it. His retinue was well chosen and
all
details
taken
into
consideration
He

At
nine-thirty
in
the
moring;
were
assembled
somewhere
near
Nasila.
Oloisudori
was
reviewing the detailed instruction that he had given each
individual who was to take part in the task ahead. Except
for him and his driver; none of the others were to appear
anywhere near Ole Kaelo's residence before six O'clock
in the evening:
were to arrive at six Oclock on the
dot, pounce o the girl, seize her; carry her into the car
and
off:
If
there
was

to

her
unconscious, that would be done on the way 
The next
stop would be at her house in Milimani Estate, Nakuru.
The
moment
Taiyo
left;
Resian's
confidence
began to wane.
She began to tremble
literally:
In
order that her mother did not notice how nervous  she
was, she excused herself and fled to their bedroom
But
on
seeing the carton into which
had packed all those
gifts   that   Oloisudori had  given  them,
and
which
she
intended to give back to him; her courage returned.
She
had   vowed
to  face
the   monster   gallantly,
and
it
was
foolish
of
her
to
develop
cold
feet
at
that
point;
especially after promising her sister that she would face
him, come
what may. She was in the battle front and
success or failure was in her hands_
She had to do it even
ifher father would never forgive her: If she rebuffed him
successfully, an inner voice told her; a whole new world
would open up before her: She had therefore to be stoic
and face the monster bravely. She glanced at the clock
beside their bed; it was a quarter to ten_

She mustered her courage, picked the carton and
quietly  left
the   bedroom
When the stately   limousine
pulled up at their gate, she was at the steps holding the
carton; aS she prepared to receive the distinguished guest
She held her breath:
She saw him alighting from the vehicle.
As usual
he was immaculately dressed:
pair of white trousers;
flowing short-sleeved
white   flower-patterned   collarless
shirt  and
white
leather
shoes.
Without

suit,
his
expensive  golden
ornaments
were

The golden chain that dangled from his neck; the golden

and

all
glittered
brilliantly in the morning sunshine. But no
wear
could disguise the arrogant power of the tall_
muscular
individual
who

stood there
beside his   powerful
machine, surveying his surroundings.
Before he noticed
her; Resian watched that pair of large black; appraising
eyes in that
brown weather beaten face_
He beamed
his glance at all directions of the home; as if to confirm
that
n0
tricks
were
being  played
on
him.
She
thought his well trimmed black moustache gave him the
look of a bandit!
When he saw
his facial features immediately
changed. He smiled at her broadly and his rapacious eyes
flickered
dangerously.

She

"Good

That   little   speech that she had memorised and
rehearsed several times, nearly took away her breath: But
it worked.
It completely disarmed Oloisudori:
He least
expected that gesture and for
brief
moment he
was
speechless.
He
took
the
carton
from her;
and  looked
appreciatively
at the square label on it,
on   which
was
written, in a flowery female handwriting:
To Mr: Oloisudori Loonkiyaa
with love
from Taiyo and Resian
What he thought was  going
to
be
a  battle of
nerves, had turned out to be a walkover.
But that did not
unduly surprise him: In fact he nearly expected it. In the
case of the other six women
who were married to him,
he had not struggled to get any of them:
Actually it was
the reverse

He  thought he
was   going
to have

disappointed though, for the anticlimax had lessened the
anticipated adventure_

"I
can't thank you and your  sister

Oloisudori
said
happily.
"Rest

beautiful lady, that this will be

He took Resian's hand and carried it to his lips
kissing her palm:

"What do you mean by our future,
Resian asked
petrified by his words.
"Don't be ridiculous, Resian,
Oloisudori said his
large eyes narrowing
a little_
"Must we repeat what is
obvious, my dear? But if I may say, YoU will never regret
the   decision  you
have   taken:
You
will be the
happiest lady in the whole of East Africa!
"What are you talking about; Sir?" Resian asked
trying to learn a little bit more_
"What
mean; is simply this;"
he said slowly like
one
talking to an obstinate child. "When you are married
to me and you are settled in your palatial home at the
Milimani
Estate
in
Nakuru, you
will
be   exceedingly

She stared at him speechlessly. His words did not
at first make sense to her_
But slowly it dawned on her
that her father had already sold her: Yes, the briefcase
that
was   handed to him contained
her   dowry  money 
What that meant was
she was literally Oloisudori's
slave. She was his playing
And as if to confirm
her fears, he stood up and began to walk towards her

"You are mad!" Resian  screamed at him:
"You
are stark mad if you think I am your wife. I can only be
your wife over my dead body. Yes, you and my father
can

carry my dead body to your palatial
home_
He was stunned by those harsh words_
He winced
as if he had been struck.
The already harsh line of his
mouth tightened and he stood tense for a moment  Then
he relaxed and watched her mockingly. "You can never
escape Resian;"
he repeated quietly, smiling:
The very
normality
of his   voice
as
he   spoke
those
monstrous
words
was
most
shocking
and
disturbing
to
her _
"Whether you scream your heart out;, Or jump into the
deep sea, Resian, you are mine.
You are my wife from
now henceforth! "
"I want to go now
Resian   announced angrily,
shuddering with disgust and teIror.
"You want to

the contemptuous
of his voice a menace by itself: "Go! You want to

heard his soft laughter behind her _
Blindly
she
ran   through
the house, blundering
into
a table and
stumbling
over
a  chair: Banging the
outer doOr; she ran and pattered down the steps ignoring
the surprised looks of Olarinkoi and Oloisudori's driver
who stood wondering what had happened
Outside, she   inhaled several  gulps of fresh air
before turning to run down the rough road that led to her
father's shop. She ran without looking back, determined
to
distance
between
her   and that  foul   tongue
of
Oloisudori
his
disgusting
eyes
and
his   intimidating
threat.
When she neared her  father's   shop;
she slowed
down and her spirit quietened
a little_
But she was still
angry.
She
was raving mad with indignation:  Her eyes
were twin rivulets from which hot tears streamed down
continuously.
Her young
was sore as she tried to
come to terms with what had just happened.
Although
she had always known that her father disliked her; she
never thought that he could go as far as selling her: How
could he do that to her? Was there a curse for being born
a woman that took away her right to her own body or her
own mind? What did the monster mean when he asserted
again
put
spirit

that she could not escape? Tearfully, she searched for the
answers
to
those
questions
but
were
not
forthcoming:
When she met three old men walking down the
same
dusty road, she peered at them through the mist of
her tearful eyes  They glanced at her curiously and one
of them kindly asked her who had beaten her:
"Na kerai, aingae likitaara?
he enquired:
"Meeta,

It was  then
that she  suddenly became aware of
her tears and her hair that she had carefully made in the

blowing  untidily
in the

wipe the tears with the back of her hand, but more tears
flowed as if
an inexhaustible source.
She had to calm down and collect her thoughts
before embarking on
fact-finding mission She would
have to behave as if nothing had happened at home so as
to hear what her father had to say about Oloisudori and
also   know
the
fate
of their request
to
enroll
at
the
Egerton University in the forthcoming academic year.
When her father saw her enter his office, he was
alarmed. He tried to read her face but she was not giving
herself away.
"Where is our  visitor?" her father asked her as
calmly and as casually as he could manage.

"Ithought I should come down here and ask what
you thought of my recent request to enroll as a student at
the   Egerton
University

the
beginning  of the

question of their enrolment to the university should crop
up
at
the   time
when

matter
about
her
marriage to Oloisudori  should presently
be occupying

She threw
her head back and screamed so loudly oe would have

She hollered,
shrieked and shrilled, saying all so1t of things to express
outrage.
She   cried, accusing
her   father of hatred and
betrayal
by   betrothing
her
to
Oloisudori:
Her
father
stared
at
her   in horror_
But   she
would
not   stop;
she
shouted even more and screamed like one possessed with
demented spirits_
After
a moment of
immobility,
her father suddenly pushed back his chair; moved fast
from behind the desk and slapped her face, sending her
reeling back so that she almost fell.
She stared at him in
disbelief:
slapped her
backhanded.
"That should teach you never to talk like that to

eyes glittering with anger.

"It is better you kill me, Papaai!' she cried out
outrageously. "You'll better kill me than hand me over to

her nose. She tried
to

flow of her tears but she could not: By then there was

of people, standing and milling around
the
building

curiously,
wondering
what

happening inside_

said in
low angry growl,

In silence, Resian turned and walked to the door

into the corridor
Then
as
she
walked through the shop; she lifted her voice, still hoarse
and screamed_

looked back ad saw her father  following her; his eyes

in her mind, she felt a

turned around: It was Olarinkoi:

asked with little interest_

language

to   consider;
Resian
thought; new hope rising in her heart. Yes, it would be

And who

to enroll
at the
Egerton University, through Emakererei:
"How could we ever get there?" asked Resian

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Resian
was   woken
up very  early the
following
morning:
The
kind-hearted
old
woman
who
accommodated her  for the night cooked porridge.
She
served the scalding, hot and sugarless porridge in
big
yellow enamel mug: Resian  shook the
mug gently
to
cool the porridge and downed it soon for she was very

were
greeted   cheerfully by Olarinkoi
and
the
driver_
Olarinkoi told Resian to climb onto the back of the pick-
up while he sat with the driver in the front cabin: The old
woman looked at Resian sitting there at the back of the
pick-up and had pity o her knowing how windy and
dusty such
ride would be. She asked the men to wait
for
a while as she went back into her house.
She came
out with
a leso and an old blanket which she handed to
Resian,  asking her to cover her head with the leso and
wrap her body with the blanket to keep herself warm and
shield herself
the wind and dust
And truly, those
two items proved to be invaluable to her; not oly
the gruelling journey but even thereafter_
Resian was in very high spirits when the journey
began: The air was crisp and refreshing

pervaded her heart and she regarded the journey
as  an
exciting adventure _
She began to whistle and hum some
cowboy tunes earlier learnt in school,
and that added
excitement and cheerfulness to her spirit now that she
was
travelling to meet her role model,
the Emakererei:
She was
n0
longer   apprehensive the way she
was  the
night before when she harboured the notion that she was
plunging into the unknown
The farther they drove towards Nasila the drier

met by
sprawling   limitless  stretch of
brown bare ground with patches of tawny grass.
In the
distance were hillocks covered by desiccated bushes of
oleleshua and olkinyei and stunted shrubs of olobaai and
oltikambu.
There
was
an occasional stand of trees and
scattered species of cactus, such as irankaun and isuguro.
Save for that scanty vegetation; Resian saw
lonely and
nearly desolate land that stretched to as far as her eyes
could see. Truly, reality had come to mock her cherished
imagination_
And it was unbearably hot! Despite the fact that
she was seated at the back of the pick-up, she could still
feel the heat.
The sun beamed down from
clear blue
sky with such torrid intensity that the metal bodywork of
the vehicle became scaldingly hot to the

unbearable. The heat sapped her  strength and the dust
and the heated air burned in her throat and lungs She felt
hot; thirsty and very uncomfortable. But the men in the
front cabin never for once bothered to look back to see
how she was faring:
By five 0'clock
were still on the road.
The
road had by then become s0 rough that the driver had to
stop
the   vehicle several times to remove boulders that
were strewn on the road.
Whenever the vehicle stopped
the dust settled on Resian in several layers. But dust was
lesser nuisance. Flies and
mosquitoes gathered around
her  eyes   and
mouth   and  crawled  into
her   nostrils
in
search
of
moisture.
The
mosquitoes
in
particular
gathered in shrilly droning clouds, attacking all areas of
her   exposed   skin
and
even
biting  through
her   dress
When
the
vehicle
resumed
motion
the
flies
and
mosquitoes menace lessened
as
were blown away
by the wind.
But the
reprieve was oly temporary until
the vehicle stopped
and the cycle was repeated.
At one point the driver

at
Resian.
Like
Olarinkoi
he
seemed
callous and irritated for reasons she did not understand_
"You, woman;
the driver called rudely, "would
you want to stretch your legs?"
Resian nodded silently and gathered the skirts of
her   dress, then   stepped
over   the
side
of the pick-up

slowly,  placing  her   foot   carefully
on
the
wheel, then
lifted the other
foot   over the  side of the  vehicle and
stepped down to the ground. The men totally ignored her
but that did not bother her
What bothered her then was
the heat, flies and mosquitoes. The moment she stepped
onto the ground, she began to sweat profusely: Her body
reeked
of
sweat
and
dust.
And
the
sweat
attracted
mosquitoes that bit her through her  dress
and   raised
lumps on her arms and legs which itched constantly:
She walked to the side of the road to a bush: But
within seconds she came back running fast screaming at
the top of her voice. She sobbingly explained that she
had seen a snake. But for reasons she did not understand,
instead of sympathising with her; the men were enraged
bitterly rebuked her for screaming:
Soon it was dark, and the temperature fell rapidly
bringing her welcome relief from the stifling heat;
But it
also brought her
a new terror.
She feared that a leopard
could easily spring from the bushes oto the pick-up and
her out, especially when the vehicle slowed down
as the ruts became impossible to cross at high speed. She_
therefore, crouched at the centre of the back of the pick-
up;

wondering
how

She gave thought to that important destination
that could change her life entirely.
She wondered how

the Emakererei:
How she wished she had a clean set of
clothes that she could put on after

confidence to face Emakererei and bravely

But as it

increased with anticipation and expectation:

But
it worried her that; other than rebuking her; Olarinkoi
had not looked at her nor spoken to her since they left
Nasila.

stepped in:

on her father and she thought how mad he was at her for

Oloisudori. Then she thought of her mother and how sad
she
was

that

move over_

moved and she got into bed beside her although she had
not washed her feet. Oh sweet bed it was! The

a loud roar of laughter:

held her effortlessly as he brutally continued fumbling
with her dress, trying to
loosen  it.
She   screamed
as
loudly
as   she could
while  she pushed him away and
thrashed frantically about_
But that did not deter him and
he totally ignored her screams holding her more firmly
with his strong
arms_
Against her loud protest; he tore
her garments and began to push her towards the bed.
Then desperately she took the last chance of self
defence and self-preservation Mustering all her strength;
she thrust his thumb into her mouth; sunk her teeth into
the flesh like
a   ferocious  animal and  tenaciously held
onto it, tugging at it fiercely like a lioness. She could feel
the flesh tearing and she tasted the salt of his blood as it
filled

nearly severing the limb.
Then suddenly, he hit her so
hard on her ribcage with his elbow, knocking the wind
out of her: He hit her
on the side of her head and
she passed out.
When  she regained her  consciousness, it came
back  gradually, like
remote  recollection of
a  distant
past incident: She felt as if a haze of tiredness had come
over her mind in the form of a
fleeting dream; floating
like mist blown by a gust of wind.

The first thing she realised
was that her mouth
tasted bitter, was
and her throat was parched
She opened her eyes lazily and looked about and around
her:
At first she did not know where she
was and how
she had been there. She was lying o

house_
The bed was covered with dirty bloody rags_
And
she
was

slowly;
she   began
to

memory. She gathered fragmented pieces of information
that were scattered in her mind and began to piece them
together:  She recalled the incident with Oloisudori, the
quarrel with her father; the trip with Olarinkoi and her
struggle with him as he tried to rape her and she had bit
his   thumb:
She could
not  remember  anything beyond
that
She noticed that someone had removed

covered
a hole on the wall above the bed to let in some
light from outside. She also noticed that someone had lit
the fire and the room was full of smoke that drifted and
found its exit through that hole above the bed. Her eyes
burned with the effect of the smoke and
filled with
tears

There
were
sensations of movement, of cold and of heat. And always
there was pain;
a continuous
unending torture and from
which there  seemed to be no escape.
Distorted images
moved about her at times, and at other times there was
only
cold and lonely darkness.   Several
moments   of
consciousness came and went.
There
were   brief moments
when   she imagined
that Oloisudori had caught up with her:
Then there were

when
the
fever  that   gripped her;
coupled with the struggle of her body to recover from the

Olarinkoi and

she realised that there

from her:
For
moment, terror returned to haunt
her: Was it Olarinkoi who had come back to torture her?
She turned her head slowly; and her eyes were met by a
kind stare from an old woman.
Their  eyes
met and held, and
Resian   recalled
faintly the motherly figure that had been nursing her:
Was it a dream
replayed in her mind from the
of her
infancy O was it the fever playing its cruel games in her
mind? But she vaguely recalled the presence of an old
woman in that room, who resembled her mother or her
Yeivo-botorr.
She
recalled

Yes, she was certain that a woman had been in that room_

the
old
woman
answered
quietly:
Resian knew enkabaani to be a nurse Or a person
who treated others_
So she wondered whether that was
her name o her profession_
But the old
woman would
not be drawn to discussing names. She told Resian not to
tire herself with unnecessary details. What should be of
importance to her; she told her; was to regain her health.
When she was back on her feet
she would tell her how
she had been lying o that bed and what happened
to her when she was unconscious_
The old lady helped Resian to
sitting position
and she braced herself on one arm.
She was   still
weak;
sweat
was
breaking out and her
arm
trembled
from the effort of
holding herself up in a

Standing outside, she had a
look at what had
been her home for the last several

structure of mud plastered walls and
a tin roof that was
spotted   with  pieces   of bark
where  the iron  sheet had
rotted or fallen off, with
couple of rickety sheds and
tiny structure that served as the toilet; made up all what
Olarinkoi called home_
It was in the middle of
plain
that stretched from the overgrazed hillside down to the
winding 'river called inkiito, at the bottom of the slope.

too became tinted with varying shades

The   sheep
were
shepherded   by
an
old
woman. And
seemed to know their home, because
when
got nearer the small Olarinkoi's homestead,
ran towards it
leaving the old woman behind.
The
old
woman
walked  directly
to
where
Resian
sat   and
stood before her:
Resian   looked
at her and  fear crept
through her weak body. Who was she? Was she a witch?
She asked herself fearfully
as   she peered
at
the ugly
woman who stood there glaring at her silently.
Resian could not estimate her age but she thought
it
was
substantial.
She
must
have
been
tall
in
her
younger days, for she now walked with
stoop. She had
arms,
and shoulders and her
flat breasts
pendulously down her thin ribs_
Resian thought
some kind of disease must have made most of her hair
come out, and what remained on her head was
cropped
in uneven patches. She appeared completely toothless
and her face was a maze of crevices and wrinkles_
But what frightened Resian most were her eyes,
or rather her eye for  she
was
mono-eyed.
She had
single, glaring, red-rimmed eye that resembled that of
the legendary enenaunerr, the monster that was said to

When they had visited their uncle's home
at Nasila;
the old woman story teller would

them those fables that frightened children to obedience_
What was before her now
was no fable_
The old witch
was real and the sight was frightening  Resian thought
the old woman did not look
strong O healthy; but
when   she thought  of her
own  health; the old
woman
could
have
been
ten
times   stronger
than
she
was
in
comparison.
"So it is you who chewed my son's hand to near

woman asked in
a low
rumbling
and
frightening
voice.
She
sneered
at

Resian
was   shocked
by
the
words
of the old
woman
and
she
stared
at
her
frightfully,
new
hopelessness and helplessness threatening to wreak more
havoc to her already wrecked nerves. But the old woman
was not finished with her yet_

then she burst out and laughed
uproariously.
"Oh
my
God! What is  this?" Resian  cried out
silently unable to bear any more the detestable, stressful
and disgusting verbiage from the old witch: She found it
offensive,
repugnant
and
downright
obnoxious.
The
much she could do was to listen to the old woman as she
spewed out her loathsome nastiness and foul grossness_

and audibly as soon as the cruel ugly old woman left her_
"What  unending

I done to the
to deserve this kind of

Then she recalled the teaching of the Bible, and
especially where it narrated the woes of those who went
through similar O even worse tribulations, but triumphed
at
the
end.
She   particularly   remembered
the
wailing
lamentations of Job and his
against injustice, and
she   thought her  problems
were
nothing  compared
to
those
he had  suffered.
He  triumphed
because
he
was
stoic, focused and was able to persevere.

she
was
going to resist  She was going to refuse to be subdued.
Where she could, she was going to physically resist  She
resolved to remain focused and she prayed for strength
and endurance to be able to bear all those misfortunes_
She had wondered where Olarinkoi was, but she
had now learnt from his mother that he was some place,
planning more evil. She had also learnt that Oloisudori;
the monster;
was
looking for her:
She now wondered
who among them
was
lesser devil:
She did not know
what to think about her father: He was like the proverbial
pig that was fried using its own lard. She thought he was
suffering double tragedy: the loss of his daughter and the
loss   of his  shop and home if
were   financed by
Oloisudori.
She
thought
of
Joseph
Parmuat
and
wondered
how
he
had
taken
the
news
of
her
disappearance.
Did
he
organise
another   enkitungatto
comb the forests of Nasila the
way he had done when
were accosted by those vagabonds?
She knew her sister Taiyo was inconsolable and
so was her mother:
But when she thought of her mother_
some bitter   bile
rose
in her  chest.
Yes;  although
she
loved her mother dearly, she had failed her: She so much
feared her husband that she was awed to silence by his
presence

when   injustices
were
being   committed

own
daughter:

pained one most was not the injustices carried
out
against oe by one's adversaries, but the silence of
those who called themselves his or her friends at the time
the injustice was
being carried out. Her mother's silence
pained her beyond
words_
Although
one had to know
which side their bread was buttered, she reasoned sadly,
there was
time when the bread and the butter were not
important. Even the hyena's
spared its own young
ones, she reasoned.
Resian was still
sitting on the log outside the
homestead
when
the
enkabaani
returned
from
her
errands_
By then the moon had risen and it was high up
in the sky. She saw her walk towards her moving slowly
as the
bright light of the moon that streamed through the
few
trees   subdued
the  colour of her skin, making her
brown   complexion
seem
darker:
She
carried
some
luggage
on her
back that  made her stoop
little.
On
seeing her  approaching; Resian's heart leapt with joy.
Although she did not even know who she was and why
she took care of her; fed her and nursed her; she had
come to
regard her as the only connection she had to the
sane world. She had promised to give an account of what
had happened to her; what was happening and what was
in the offing: She was
eager to know all that so that
she could plan her next move.
She knew she was   still
weak
but
she
was
grateful that she
was   steadily and

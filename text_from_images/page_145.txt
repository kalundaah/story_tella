When they later walked into the practice room
they found Resian waiting for them, sitting as she always
did hunched up in a chair, her nose determinedly buried
in a book. If she detected anything strange with her sister
and their adopted brother, she did not show.

Taiyo was exhilarated beyond words. She was
simply in a seventh heaven. From the first day she saw
Joseph Parmuat, during her father's homecoming
ceremony, she had fallen in love with him instantly. She
thought he was the incarnation, the very picture of her
dreams. She recalled the way it happened. She had been
standing there with her sister Resian, their eyes glued to
the handsome, arrogantly athletic morans who cut such a
dash, as they danced and shrieked boisterously. She was
greatly attracted by the way they moved to the centre of
the circle, and one by one or in pairs, jumped high up in
the air in step with the guttural chants of the other
morans as they heaved their chests forwards and
backwards excitedly. One moran in particular caught her
eye. He was unique among the rest in that he was dark-
haired while the rest had smeared greasy red ochre into
their hair. He was a tall lithe young man, who, when he
got his chance to jump, leapt higher and with more grace
than any of the others. She was immediately attracted to
him and herâ€™ gaze henceforth riveted upon
him. The attraction translated into love. And from that
day, she was besotted with that love.

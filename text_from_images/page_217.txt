gives me courage to face him. To speak the truth, when I
think of the monster, I squirm in my shoes with fear!"

"What you should never accept, little sister,"
Taiyo told her sister emphatically, "is to be left alone in
the house with the monster. However brave you are, you
cannot be locked with a boa-constrictor in a room and
expect to survive."

"That I know, Taiyo-e-yeiyo," Resian answered
timidly. "I would only accept to be in the living room
with Oloisudori, if yeivo is going to be in the kitchen. I
can't take that risk."

Little did the girls know that their parents and
Oloisudori had also hatched their plan. So when Ole
Kaelo discussed with his wife Oloisudori's day and time
of arrival, he was apprehensive. Knowing how stubborn
Resian was, he was not sure how they would lure her and
make her accept to be with Oloisudori in their living
room. It had, been agreed that Oloisudori would arrive
the following day at ten o'clock in the morning.

After the visit was made known to the girls, and
it was suggested that Resian was to receive and serve
him with coffee, the parents were most surprised that
Resian accepted the proposal without a fight. Ole Kaelo
wondered whether the dream he had had was coming to
pass. He hoped the rest of their plan would be as smooth
and that Resian would accept Oloisudori's proposal
without much ado. They had decided that Taiyo would
be sent to their uncle's home to help their yeiyo-botorr.

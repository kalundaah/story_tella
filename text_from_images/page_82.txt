taught to solely please male counterparts. They can also
cook, and they can, and should also learn to please us
females. Period!"

Yeiyo-botorr was shocked. Mama Milanoi was
dumbfounded and was at a complete loss for words.
Taiyo stared at her sister in consternation.
"Resian-siake-!" pleaded Taiyo "Please give respect to
yeiyo botorr and stop your uncalled for tirade.

"But surely, Resian," her mother said, regaining
her composure. "Have you no respect for your father
who is also male? What have gotten into you, child,
lately?" Turning to the girl's aunt, she added "enkaini,
Yeivo-botorr, this child was not like this before we came
here. I don't know what has gone wrong."

"Nothing is wrong with me," Resian retorted
furiously. And pointing at the living room with her
finger, she fiercely charged, "I have no quarrel with my
father for whom, I have tremendous respect. It is the
likes of Olarinkoi I am mad at, and all those other males
who come here ordering us to do that or the other for
them, simply because they are males. When women visit
us, they give us the leeway to respond to their requests.
But as we burn our fingers here, Mr. Olarinkoi is dozing
off comfortably in our living room waiting for his lunch
and possibly a little angry and impatient with us for
delaying it."

"It is enough," cried yeiyo-botorr viciously. She
instantly abandoned the peeling of potatoes and threw
the knife into the pail that held the peeled potatoes.
Supporting herself by holding onto a nearby wall, she
painfully lifted her large, heavy body. "My enkaini, I
agree with you that something is wrong with our child.

abandoned her o/kuenyi and accepted to be married to
Oloisudori, he told himself, she would soon have her
own establishment and a wealthy husband who had
much ambition. But, even with all those pleasurable
convictions, the mention of Oloisudori's name brought a
wry twist to Ole Kaelo's lips.

Once convinced, Ole Kaelo also persuaded his
wife that all what remained for them to do was find an
agreeable and amicable way of handing Resian to
Oloisudori.

The return of Taiyo and Resian brought back life
to the nearly desolate home. Excited laughter and
exchange of bantering remarks returned in earnest. They
were elated at having visited their uncle's home and they
hoped to continue and maintain the established
relationship.

Their mother told them of the vagabond saga;

one of the apprehended villains Ntara Muyo, was their
cousin. He was a son to one of her sisters, married to an
Tlukumae man called Muyo. When she told them of the
council of elders' verdict and the number of cattle each
villain had to pay as a fine, Resian hit the roof with
indignation.
"No, never!" she thundered angrily, "Yeiyo, that can't be.
The thugs must be arrested and taken to court so that
they go to jail. The least they should get is twenty-years
jail term."

the Maa women was still strong and kicking." Joseph
Parmuat said triumphantly and ended his story.

"Oh God!" exclaimed Taiyo, shocked, "is that a
true story?"

"It is a true story," Joseph Parmuat confirmed
seriously. "And it has been handed down from
generation to generation with very little added to it. If
you want to know, that was the origin of the so called
Female Genital Mutilation that the likes of Emakererei
have devoted their lives to fight."

"Resian and I are soon joining her to fight the
repugnant ritual," Taiyo said equally serious.

"T'll join you too," he said roaring with laughter.
"But direct your fire at the right target. It is the women
and not men who founded what eventually became a
tradition. And it is only women who would end it if they
so desired."

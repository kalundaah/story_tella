Should Joseph Parmuat fulfill those two promises,
she would be utterly satisfied. But all depended on her
father.

Resian's situation grew worse. The moment she
got beneath the blankets, tears began to run freely.
Whether their cause lay in the inescapable loneliness that
seemed to stalk her like a lost young leopard, or in the
intolerable confusion caused by the ever present
insecurity, she could not tell. All she knew was that her
world was spinning. Even her bed seemed to be moving.

The pain in her heart was like the bruising
aftermath of a blow. She closed her eyes, took a deep
breath, then she exhaled slowly, forcing herself to face
the shattering situation that threatened to destroy the
world she had known until then. The threat of
circumcision was becoming real. Old Ole Musanka had
said they should undergo the rite.

She shuddered when she recalled the day the
enkamuratani visited their house in the company of other
village women. She was a thin old woman of about sixty
years and of average height whose back and shoulders
still stood straight. Unlike the other women who were
dressed in traditional shukas, she wore a tee shirt that
was much too large for her frame, and a heavy, shapeless
skirt-like garment. Her gnarled, calloused feet were bare.
When Taiyo, burning with curiosity, had asked her to
show them her tools of trade, she had sprung up with the
agility of a young woman and dashed swiftly to where
she had left her bag on the table. After rummaging about
among her things, she had fished out a dirty oilskin that
she held aloft while she triumphantly, like one who had
won a match, grinned and stared at them.

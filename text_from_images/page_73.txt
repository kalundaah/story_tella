They were about to settle in their seats when they
heard a knock. A man they had not seen before entered
and greeted them confidently. Without waiting to be
invited, he proceeded to find a seat. But that was not
queer for it was in line with the Nasilian hospitality
where every house was open to all sojourners. The girls
looked askance at the man they considered an intruder.
He was a quiet, well-built man of thirty or so. He wore a
brown pair of trousers and a blue shirt that was not
particularly neat. Taiyo thought there was something
impersonal about his offhand attitude.

Until he told them what he wanted, or what he
was up to, Mama Milanoi and her daughters had to
contend with accommodating two incompatible guests in
their living room.

He himself would be at the shop while Resian would
remain with her mother at home to wait for Oloisudori.

The plan also suited the girls. They had already
packed Oloisudori gifts in a decorated carton that was
now awaiting delivery to the owner.

When Resian appeared for breakfast the
following morning, her parents were astonished. Her
father suppressed an alarming premonition that suddenly
nagged his old heart. Her mother stared at her daughter
confusedly, not knowing whether to appreciate or allow
the astonishment take the better of her. She opted to keep
silent and watched with amazement the transformation
of their usually sullen daughter into a cheerful and jovial
child. But what amazed them most was the apparent
preparation she had made for that morning.

She was clad in her maroon taffeta dress whose
stark neckline was softened by a cream and maroon
silken scarf that fluttered about her neck. Her usually
braided hair had been carefully made and piled softly
upon her head. Her golden colour earrings glinted in the
morning sunshine as they swung, emphasizing the
graceful length of her neck. She carried in her hand a
maroon handbag that matched the colour of her shoes.
The effect of her attire was dazzling and contrasted
sharply with Tatyo who was wearing her usual simple
blue dress.

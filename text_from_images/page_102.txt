added acidly, "sometimes your behaviour borders on
imbecility. Who is he?"

"He says his name is Oloisudori," she said in a
subdued voice, her eyes downcast.

"Oh, my God!" her father exclaimed under his
breath, straightening up, his eyes suddenly dilating
widely. "Oloisudori of all people! Oh my God! I wonder
what has gone wrong for him to come looking for me!"

"I don't know, Papaai," Resian said concernedly,
worried at the turn of events. "He was saying ..."

Her father ignored her. Brushing past her, he
strode briskly into the living room with both his arms
outstretched in front of him, ready to embrace his visitor.

"Oloisudori Loonkiyaa!" he called out loudly,
laughing in feigned excitement. "What an unexpected
pleasure to have you in my house. I hope all is well, my
dear brother."

"The pleasure is mutual, brother Ole Kaelo,"
Oloisudori said importantly, struggling to stand in order
to receive Ole Kaelo's hug. "I assure you all things are
under control."

It was then that Resian, who had followed her
father to the living room noted that the two men were of
the same height and possibly of the same age. But what
greatly perturbed her, was to hear a slight tremor in her
father's voice as he addressed Oloisudori. She certainly
detected a measure of desperation and fear in him. She
noticed a faint sheen of perspiration on his face and
Oloisudori took advantage of her father's discomfiture to
grin at her, as if to gleefully tell her "you see, what did I
tell you?"

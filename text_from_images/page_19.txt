that the four houses belonged to their four aunts who,
they were informed the previous night, were the wives of
their uncle. Between the houses stood smaller buildings
that were overshadowed by massive yellow- trucked
acacia trees. Interspersed were olive-green iloirienito
trees whose fragrant foliage filled the air with their
aromatic scent. Flights of birds flashed between the trees
and the air was alive with their constant motion and
cheerful calls.

"Hope our home will look like this," said Resian
with enthusiasm.

"It's so calm and peaceful here. It's the kind of home one
would look forward to come back to at the end of the
college semester."

"Children," a woman's voice called from an
adjacent room. "Come out and have your tea."

They quickly dressed up and within no time, they
were out of the house and one of their aunts was leading
them to the next house to join the rest of the family for
morning tea.

The three crossed the courtyard talking happily,
the girls walking closely behind their aunt. Like the
house they had slept in, the next two houses they walked
past were built of heavy cedar slabs, had similar wooden
shutters for windows and were roofed with green painted
corrugated iron sheets. Standing beside each house, on
raised platforms made of strong cedar beams were large,
black plastic water tanks that collected rain water from
the roofs. Chicken clucked and scratched in the cool
shade underneath. Clusters of bushes of olobaai with
their shinny dark-green leaves and tiny yellow flowers
scattered the compound. //kilenya climbers grew around

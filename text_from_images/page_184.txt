strengthening of their independence and a diminishing of
their parents authority over them. The change in the
relationship between Resian and her father was less
subtle. It appeared that her father became aware of the
possibility of a serious rift between him and his daughter,
and apparently went to greater pains to make himself
more congenial. She was still moody and sullen at times
but ever since they began interacting with their uncle's
family, she was consistently more amicable. However,
their mother still found Resian's attitude to life
unpredictable and her daughter's grasp of her personality
remained vague.

One pleasant thing the girls noticed when they
began interacting freely with Nasila people, was that the
men began to treat them differently. There Were no more
impudent stares and grins when they walked past them.
One or two surreptitiously stared or watched from the
distance, but when they passed near them, they were
greeted with respect. Some of the younger men grinned
and spoke in a friendly manner mixed with admiration.
But the older men regarded them with a friendly and
almost fatherly attitude. The girls had never been happier.
A feeling of involvement developed as they came to
know more people in Nasila.

Little did they know it was a lull before a
turbulent storm.

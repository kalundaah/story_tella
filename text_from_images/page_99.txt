Her mother was stirring a vegetable stew when
Resian entered, and she glanced abstractedly at her.
"Who was that?" she asked.

"A man who says his name is Oloisudori," she
said acidly. "He says he has come to see Papaai."

"Oloisudori? Let me see ... Oloisudori?" her
mother said repeatedly, rolling her eyes to the ceiling as
she tried to place the name. Failing to remember where
she had heard that name, she shook her head, "No, I
don't think I know a man by that name."

"Whoever he is, Yeiyo" said Resian angrily, "he
is amannerless old man!"

"Check your tongue, child!" her mother rebuked
her harshly. "Soon you are going to disgrace your father
by the way you speak. Didn't you see the way you
horrified your yeiyo-botorr the other day when you
spoke like one with a demented spirit? You must bridle
your tongue. Be careful of what you say, otherwise you
will soon be called enadua-kutuk."

"I am sorry, Yeiyo" said Resian remorsefully.
"But surely, yeiyo, mustn't one mention the despicable
character of an old man who behaves badly before a girl
young enough to be his daughter?"

"However disreputable the man may be," her
mother warned her, "be careful Resian. We don't know
what connection the man has with your father and it
would be catastrophic if your tongue would be the one to
sever his relations with other men. Go to the living room
and tell him I'm busy preparing lunch. Get him a cup of
tea or something else to drink and make him comfortable
before your father comes. I am sure he will be here
soon."

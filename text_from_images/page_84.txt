through circumcision the ill-spirit could be purged away,
once and for all, was not new to her.

When she was young, a lot of diseases and
especially those which could not be properly diagnosed
were managed through a blood-letting treatment known
as angam. In that practice, several nicks were made on
the ailing sections of the body and the blood sucked out.
She wondered whether she should tell her husband about
her enkaini's diagnosis of their daughter's ailment. She
would not be surprised if he summoned the
enkamuratani the first thing the following morning with
her o/murunya, and have the job done forthwith. If that
happened, she knew it would terribly hurt the girls.

Although Taiyo did not like Olarinkoi, she did
not hate him. She just did not care a hoot whether he ate
or slept hungry. She wondered why her sister Resian
hated him with such passion. And thinking of the man,
she wondered who he was. Their father did not indicate
that he was of their clan IImolelian, the way he told them
about Joseph Parmuat. Who was he then? What was his
background? And what was he doing in their home day
in day out? Although he did odd jobs in their compound,
Taiyo knew he was not an employee, and in fact when
their father wanted a thorough job done at the compound,
he always hired a man to do it. And obviously the
occasional foodstuff that he brought into the house could
not be the reason that made their father tolerate him. She
knew their father was well-off and did not depend on the
miserly bundles of food that Olarinkoi occasionally
brought into their house. What was his mission in their
home?

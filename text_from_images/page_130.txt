CHAPTER NINE

Joseph Parmuat began to coach Resian and Taiyo
in traditional song and dance. He did it every evening
after school. But soon, Resian's interest in the coaching
quickly fizzled out and waned. She knew her
unquenchable thirst was in university education and that
could not be substituted for anything else. She eventually
stopped attending and left Tatyo to be coached alone.

Soon, Taiyo found her happiness. She looked
forward to seeing Joseph Parmuat in the evening, and
when at the end of the practice session, time came for
them to part, she was reluctant to leave. Over the past
weeks, she had unexpectedly discovered a haven, a place
of song, dance and laughter in that room. It was truly a
place of relaxed companionship and mutual
understanding. She found a place where she could enjoy
song and dance with someone who through ties of Nasila
kinship, and shared interest, related with her on one-on-
one basis.

Joseph Parmuat also enjoyed Taiyo's company.
He found it a joy to coach her, and dancing with her
elicited a deep elation. He was, however, cautious in the
way he expressed that elation. Ever since he knew that
the Kaelos were from the IImolelian clan and of the
Tloorasha-kineji sub-clan, like his family, he considered
Ole Kaelo to be his father according to their culture. He
tried to internalise that Taiyo and Resian were his sisters.

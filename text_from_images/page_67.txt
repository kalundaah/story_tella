with the culture. Who would side with her if she were to
oppose the cultural rituals?

Her only ally would be the woman the elders of
Nasila contemptuously called entangoroi or the wasp.
Those who honoured her called her Emakererei, for she
was said to have attended Makerere University in
Uganda, where she obtained her degree in Veterinary
Science. Mama Milanoi knew her well. Her actual names
were Minik ene Nkoitoi. Outside Nasila, she was
respected and honoured. At thirty, she was already
managing an expansive government sheep ranch reputed
to hold hundreds of thousands of sheep, about one
hundred kilometers away from Nasila. Under her were
hundreds of employees who worked at the ranch.

In Nasila, however, she was regarded as the devil
incarnate. She was hated and reviled for criticizing and
campaigning vigorously against the traditions that she
said abused the rights of the girl child namely girls'
circumcision and early marriages. And that had put her
in direct collision with the people of Nasila. If she
aligned herself with a person who Nasila regarded as
having such an obnoxious reputation, where would her
marriage stand?

As she lay beside her husband, she gave thought
to what they stood for as a family. What did they believe
in? Were they traditionalists or were they modernists? In
embracing the retrogressive cultural values, were they
now progressing or regressing? Although Ole Kaelo had
always been arrogant and impolite in his own way, she
had discovered right from the time he married her that he
had his own unique chivalrous qualities that neutralized
his hubris.

are courageous both physically and mentally. In the first
five days after the assault, I did not think you were going
to live. You were very weak and you had lost a lot of
blood through that nose-bleeding. But you fought on.
You had a will to live. Even now I believe you have a
will to go places. I don't know what enkoiboni has
predicted but, I am willing to help you do what you
intend to do or go where you want to go once you are
back onto your feet, with or without enkoiboni's
predictions."

That was music in Resian's ears! A surge of
renewed energy spurted in her veins. She suddenly fell to
her knees and hugged the legs of the old woman,
washing them with her tears.

"My own God given mother!" she sobbed. "May
God bless you."

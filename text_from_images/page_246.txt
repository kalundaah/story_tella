terror and panic. She tried to get away from him, but he
held her effortlessly as he brutally continued fumbling
with her dress, trying to loosen it. She screamed as
loudly as she could while she pushed him away and
thrashed frantically about. But that did not deter him and
he totally ignored her screams holding her more firmly
with his strong arms. Against her loud protest, he tore
her garments and began to push her towards the bed.

Then desperately she took the last chance of self
defence and self-preservation. Mustering all her strength,
she thrust his thumb into her mouth; sunk her teeth into
the flesh like a ferocious animal and tenaciously held
onto it, tugging at it fiercely like a lioness. She could feel
the flesh tearing and she tasted the salt of his blood as it
filled her mouth but she clung unto the thumb as
Olarinkoi howled with pain. He tried to push her away
but she held on. He cried out loudly, but she was
relentless as she dug deeper and deeper into the flesh,
nearly severing the limb. Then suddenly, he hit her so
hard on her ribcage with his elbow, knocking the wind
out of her. He hit her again on the side of her head and
she passed out.

When she regained her consciousness, it came
back gradually, like a remote recollection of a distant
past incident. She felt as if a haze of tiredness had come
over her mind in the form of a fleeting dream; floating
like mist blown by a gust of wind.

"Yeiyo, shall we prepare a meat stew or a
vegetable stew to go with the rice for lunch?" asked
Taiyo as they neared the end of the breakfast.

"No, don't prepare anything." We have asked
Maison to organise lunch for you at the shop. Your
father and I are going out for some business and we shall
not be back until this evening."

Ole Kaelo shot a significant glance at his wife
who, impervious, worked with neat dexterity at her
crochet. He then turned and looked at Resian with a
piteous mien. Resian observed that her father was
troubled but she did not know the reason. She wondered
if his troubles had anything to do with the business
taking him away for the day.

Taiyo's happiness insulated her from any feelings.
Her mind was preoccupied by a pleasurable expectation
that seemed to drag the hours of the day. She eagerly
looked forward to meeting Joseph Parmuat in the
evening so that she could express to him the ecstatic
feeling borne of their newly found love.
The girls went to the shop where they were kept busy by
Maison, the manager, who gave them stock bin cards,
the records of which they were to reconcile with the
physical stocks. They were delighted to find that he had
prepared them a delicious lunch of nyama choma served
with ugali.

At about three, they took their leave and set to go
home. It was a hot afternoon and the heat was oppressive.

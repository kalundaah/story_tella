the changed it brought. And the changes were not only
subtle but insidious, threatening an explosion in the not
too distant future.

Their yeiyo-kiti told them that she had been
observing a new trend that other people might have
ignored. A few of those Nasila sons and daughters who
had emigrated to towns, were now slowly returning to
settle in the rural areas. She gave the example of their
own father, Minik ene Nkoitoi the Emakererei, Reteti
Korema, Setek Tumbes and a few others. Depending on
how successful their return would be, she said, they
might influence other people in towns to follow suit on
finding that life in the rural areas could be meaningful
and bearable.

The girls were excited to learn that their yeiyo-
kiti was known to their role model, Minik-ene Nkoitoi,
the Emakerereei. She told them they originated from the
same village called Mbenek Dapashi and they went to
the same primary school. But being four years older,
Minik left her behind when she passed her examination
and was called to join high school away from their
village. Years later after she was married, she learnt that
Minik had gone to Makerere University where she
studied veterinary medicine and acquired the name of
Emakererei.

They were very interested in Emakererei's story
for in her story, they saw themselves. "Was she
circumcised?" they asked their yeiyo-kiti mischievously.

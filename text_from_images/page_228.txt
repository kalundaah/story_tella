"I left him at home enjoying his tea and
pancakes," Resian answered calmly without batting an
eyelid.

"And what brings you to the shop this time of the
day instead of remaining at home to help your mother?"

"I'll go back there, Papaai, as soon as possible,"
Resian answered pleasantly, trying to be as calm as she
could, "I thought I should come down here and ask what
you thought of my recent request to enroll as a student at
the Egerton University at the beginning of the new
academic year this September."

"University?" her father asked astonished that the
question of their enrolment to the university should crop
up at the time when a weightier matter about her
marriage to Oloisudori should presently be occupying
her mind. He got confused and wondered what had taken
place between her and Oloisudori. He cleared his throat
portentously and said, "I thought about it alright, but
decided that I am not sending- you there!"

"Why not, Papaai?" she asked angrily as she
stood rigidly before her father's desk, her hands clasped
firmly to prevent them from trembling.

"Because I think for now, you have had enough
of formal education," he answered eyeing her sharply,
and then stretched his arm, took some papers from a tray
at the far end of the table and leafed through them.
"There is always time for further education later and ..."

"But Papaai," she interrupted him.

age they might consider what he was saying as
ridiculously irrelevant, he knew by experience that there
was nothing better than beginning to plan for one's future
early. He warned the girls that they might find a few
cultural demands obnoxious but they would have to be
stoic and accept them with the understanding that it was
those not-too-pleasant traditions that nurtured and bound
their people together. "And those families that had
refused to rejoin their people," he added thoughtfully,"

That was the most exciting news that Taiyo had
received ever since they came to Nasila. She was
exultant. Although their father never for once mentioned
that Joseph Parmuat was to coach her in traditional
music and dance, the fact that he had allowed them to
interact with him filled her heart with joy. She could
hardly hide her elation. Even the repeated assertion that
Joseph Parmuat was their brother by virtue of their
cultural links, failed to daunt her spirit. Was she simply
infatuated with him? If she was, she hoped the feeling
would soon simmer down. What pleased her most,
however, was that she now had a confidant whom she
could ask some of those embarrassing questions that she
could not dare ask her mother or anybody else.

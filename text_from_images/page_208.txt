prepared enough to behold the imposing and splendid
buildings that stood before them. They were humbled.

They were in a cluster of red-tiled houses whose
tall outer walls painted in brilliant white, surrounded one
large two-storied building that was also of the same
colour. A few metres from the fence that enclosed the
homestead, was the expansive Lake Naivasha and across
it was a scenic sight of hills and a forest that covered
them. As he watched the hippopotamuses frolicking in
the lake water, Ole Kaelo thought of the grandeur of
nature. He could not help but chuckle a little, amused by
the fact that, Oloisudori and the hippopotamuses were
two different kinds of animals that nature had brought to
live side by side, each minding its own business.

The house was awesome. Kaelo had more than
once made to nudge his wife when she stood by the
windy corridors of the magnificent house, mesmerized at
the elegant and luxurious rooms that lay open wide ready
for viewing. The living room was lavishly furnished and
the furnishing must have been done by a person whose
mind must have been preoccupied by the need to be
showy, and ostentatious.

When they were introduced to the lady of the
house, who was simply referred to as wife number three,
they thought she was as beautiful as her surroundings.
She was taciturn but friendly and she served them with
dignity and decorum.

the living room and order them to serve them with
breakfast.

When they got used to what they first considered
to be negative aspects of Nasila culture, Taiyo and
Resian adjusted accordingly and soon they began to live
harmoniously with the people. Their father was out of
the homestead most of the time working at the shop and
organising other business matters. His absence also
meant the absence of his irksome and corrosive remarks
that always heightened tension in the house. In his
absence, the house was a continuous joy with comfort
and conveniences, and the girls found it a pleasure to
keep it clean and well arranged.

Mingling with the women folk, the girls learnt a
great deal about the hilarious, the absurd and the weird
aspects of Nasila culture. They also met a variety of
women. Although most of the women who visited the
Parsimei's home did so for entertainment purposes,
others visited with definite purposes. A great number of
them came to survey and get to know the girls well, so
that they could have sufficient information on which to
decide whether they were marriageable, and
commendable to their husbands to be married as their
inkainito. Others came looking for potential wives for
their sons while enkaitoyoni and enkamuratani came to
make acquaintance with potential clients.

So when their father announced one evening that
he was planning a homecoming ceremony, the girls and
especially Taiyo no longer felt like strangers.

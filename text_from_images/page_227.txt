that she could not escape? Tearfully, she searched for the
answers to those questions but they were not
forthcoming.

When she met three old men walking down the
same dusty road, she peered at them through the mist of
her tearful eyes. They glanced at her curiously and one
of them kindly asked her who had beaten her.

"Na kerai, aingae likitaara?" he enquired.

"Meeta," she answered demurely her eyes
downcast.

It was then that she suddenly became aware of
her tears and her hair that she had carefully made in the
morning but which was now blowing untidily in the
dusty wind. She rubbed at her swollen eyelids, trying to
wipe the tears with the back of her hand, but more tears
flowed as if from an inexhaustible source.

She had to calm down and collect her thoughts
before embarking on a fact-finding mission. She would
have to behave as if nothing had happened at home so as
to hear what her father had to say about Oloisudori and
also know the fate of their request to enroll at the
Egerton University in the forthcoming academic year.

When her father saw her enter his office, he was
alarmed. He tried to read her face but she was not giving
herself away.

"Where is our visitor?" her father asked her as
calmly and as casually as he could manage.

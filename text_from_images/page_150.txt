bird cooed sorrowfully, it was always a harbinger of bad
news. Its cry was always ominous.

It was different with Taiyo. Her mood was
upbeat. Even her mother had noticed that in the last few
days she had become extremely happy. She carried out
her housekeeping duties while humming, whistling or
singing loudly. What a wonderful daughter she had in
Taiyo, her mother repeatedly thought happily, while
observing the way she satisfactorily played her multiple
roles as first-born daughter of the Kaelo family, sister to
Resian, capable organiser in the home, ever present help
as a housekeeper and a most cherished companion to her
mother. Her mother thought her daughter's new found
happiness was a welcome ray of sunshine in a home
where gloom, and despondency had become a hallmark.

After procrastinating for quite some time, Ole
Kaelo and his wife decided to seek help. Ole Kaelo
would consult his friend and mentor, Ole Supeyo, while
his wife would consult her inkainito, the wives of
Simiren, Ole Kaelo's brother.

That morning's breakfast was taken in a sombre
mood. Olarinkoi was the only one who did not seem to
be preoccupied. His ubiquitous presence at every meal
had now been accepted by everyone in the home. His
silence and withdrawn nature nearly made him invisible,
which was the opposite of Ole Kaelo whose presence
dominated the room.

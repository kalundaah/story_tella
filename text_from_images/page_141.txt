made her jump. Joseph Parmuat stood with a surprised
look in his eyes.

"I'm so sorry for intruding into your house,"
Taiyo said her face with its usually brown complexion
becoming ashamed with embarrassment.
"It's okay," Joseph Parmuat replied, an inscrutable smile
on his face. "This is your brother's house and you are
welcome any time."

There was a fleeting moment of silence that drew
her eyes to his face. He too lifted his eyes to hers, and
for the briefest of seconds, the two pairs of eyes met and
held.

"I felt a bit bored and I thought I could call on
you so that we can walk back to our house ..." she
stopped, swamped in confusion. Then she added quietly,
"I am sorry. I suppose I really should not have come."

"Don't be ridiculous," he said still smiling. He
dropped the bag he had carried onto the bed. "I have just
been to the shops to purchase a few items before coming
to your place."

There was another moment of silence in which
neither of them moved.

"Joseph," she began eloquently. "There is need
for us to talk about us."

"No, Taiyo, my dear sister," he protested
vehemently. "There is no need for us to discuss matters
we know are hurtful to us."

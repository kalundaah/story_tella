busy cleaning them and making them ready to be stuffed
with the already chopped cooked meat.

It was when Taiyo and Resian went into yeiyo-
botorr's house, where all the children were seated
together with their mothers and uncle Simiren, that they
were surprised to find their parents present. Apart from
being totally unexpected, their visit was an anticlimax of
some sort, coming at the time when they were really
enjoying themselves.

Later in the evening, when the children of the
four houses learnt that their sisters whom they had come
to love so much had to go back to their home, they all
cried without restraint.

But what awaited them at their home, only their
parents knew. However, Resian felt apprehensive when
on more than one occasions, her father glanced at her
furtively. In the past she had got used to her father
glaring at her with disapproval but she thought the
sheepish look in his eyes was frightening and only time
would tell what it portended.

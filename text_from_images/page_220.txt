At nine-thirty in the morning, they were
assembled somewhere near Nasila. Oloisudori was
reviewing the detailed instruction that he had given each
individual who was to take part in the task ahead. Except
for him and his driver, none of the others were to appear
anywhere near Ole Kaelo's residence before six o'clock
in the evening. They were to arrive at six o'clock on the
dot, pounce on the girl, seize her, carry her into the car
and speed off. If there was need to render her
unconscious, that would be done on the way. The next
stop would be at her house in Milimani Estate, Nakuru.

The moment Taiyo left, Resian's confidence
began to wane. She began to tremble quite literally. In
order that her mother did not notice how nervous she
was, she excused herself and fled to their bedroom. But
on seeing the carton into which they had packed all those
gifts that Oloisudori had given them, and which she
intended to give back to him, her courage returned. She
had vowed to face the monster gallantly, and it was
foolish of her to develop cold feet at that point,
especially after promising her sister that she would face
him, come what may. She was in the battle front and
success or failure was in her hands. She had to do it even
if her father would never forgive her. If she rebuffed him
successfully, an inner voice told her, a whole new world
would open up before her. She had therefore to be stoic
and face the monster bravely. She glanced at the clock
beside their bed; it was a quarter to ten.

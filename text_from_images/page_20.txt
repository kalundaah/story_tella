the beams that supported the water tanks and climbed
over the walls of the houses, making them look cool and
comfortable.

The last house on the row was next to the main
gate through which they had entered the homestead the
previous night. It was different from the previous three.
It was larger and was built of stone and had glass
windows and like the others, its corrugated iron-sheet
roof was painted green. The front door was ajar and
standing smilingly next to it was a stout woman of forty-
five or so who greeted the girls affectionately. She eyed
them curiously as they responded to the greetings. She
introduced herself as Yeiyoo-botorr which meant she
was their senior-most aunt and the eldest wife of their
uncle.

They were led to a spacious living room whose
large open glass windows faced the east allowing in
bright morning sunlight. The light shone on the young
faces whose wide eyes stared unashamedly at the two
young women who Yeiyoo-botorr was introducing as
their sisters. The sixteen or so children aged between
three and sixteen were perched on benches, stools and
chairs around the room, each holding a steaming enamel
tea mug on one hand and a slice of bread on the other.
Their mothers were there too and so was Mama Milanoi
who sat placidly admiring the composure of her own
daughters. It was only after the children were reassured
that their new sisters were not visitors and that they
would be seeing them often, that calm returned and they
resumed taking their tea and bread. Room was created at
the table and Taiyo and Resian sat with their cousins.

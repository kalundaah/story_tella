Seeing that they had the whole morning to
themselves after breakfast, Taiyo and Resian told their
mother they wanted to take a walk around the
neighborhood. She allowed them but cautioned care and
wariness of strangers who might take advantage of their
unfamiliarity. The girls looked at one another and
giggled. They dismissed their mother's misplaced fears
as born of the misconception by the old generation that
girls were weaklings, incapable of deciding what was
right.

Their mother watched them as they walked
leisurely down the path out of their uncle's homestead.
For reasons she did not understand, a pang of a strange
premonition twisted her nerves unpleasantly. A creepy
feeling kept on gnawing at her conscience regarding her
daughtersâ€™ status of being intoiye nemengalana, in the
midst of a community that cherished  girl-child
circumcision. She, however, dismissed the feeling and
relegated it to the back of her mind.

"What do you make of our uncle Simiren's
home?" Resian asked her sister quietly as they walked
down the path.

"Honestly, I don't think all is well. Beneath the
veneer of apparent happiness, I detected some
apprehension, a subtle rivalry of some sort, between the
four houses." "What a terrible person you are, my dear
sister!" Taiyo rebuked her sister mildly. "You are not
worth being a guest in anyone's home. How dare you
make such judgment? Their life seems to suit them
perfectly."

"Easy, easy, big sister," said Resian teasingly.

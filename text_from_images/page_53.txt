Across the room, maternal instincts directed
Mama Milanoi to look at the direction of her daughter,
Taiyo, in time to see two events happening
simultaneously: a handsome young man striding towards
her daughter and her husband sending a seemingly
corrosive glance in the direction of his daughter.

One can never tell with Ole Kaelo, Mama
Milanoi thought aloud. He can be the most dreadful
spoilsport.

Ole Kaelo, however, did not interfere and Mama
Milanoi watched from across the room, smiling a little,
as the two young people met. How lovely Taiyo looked
that night! She thought she was her very image when she
was at her age. She watched the two as they exchanged
greetings and their smiles as their eyes met. Then he
seemed to ask her a question and she, with downcast
eyes, gave him a demure smile. For a moment, Mama
Milanoi stood there allowing a ridiculous small blade of
envy cut through her heart. She let her heart wander and
wondered what might have happened had she met a
handsome young man such as the one her daughter was
speaking with, fallen in love and got married. If she had
had such an opportunity, what might her life have been?
Maybe she would not have been joined at the hip with a
bully like ....

"Do you know that young man your daughter is
talking to?" It was her brother-in-law Simiren standing
beside her. "She needs to be informed immediately."

"Is he a bad boy?" Mama Milanoi asked urgently
fearing for her daughter.

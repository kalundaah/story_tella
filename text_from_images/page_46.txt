father winced, grimaced and struggled to control his
temper. This that was not a day to get angry. But all the
same, he wondered where in the world they fetched that
awkward, overblown, stupid child. Her gracelessness
appalled him. And the very look in her eyes, half- fearful,
half-defiant and wholly troubled, was always enough to
raise his temper to the highest pitch. He clicked his
tongue irritably and quickly left the room.

At noon, Ole Kaelo's spacious homestead was
nearly full to capacity. There was pomp all over and a
carnival atmosphere resonant with song and dance hung
in the air. A bevy of beautiful, young women stepped
forward, their necks bedecked with layer after layer of
exquisite multicoloured bead ormaments. The bright-
coloured /esos they wore over their shoulders fluttered in
the windy afternoon air as they moved sedately, heads
poised, chests heaving forwards and backwards, knees
bobbing, voices raised melodiously, as they glided
smoothly into an exciting traditional dance.

Two young men out of a group of about twenty
began to sing in their light melodic voices. The rest
joined in, their deep guttural voices mingling with those
of the young women. The moment the voices mingled
and fused, the dance changed subtly. The men's group
broke into two, each with a light, springy jump. They
skipped away as they skirted the compound, and joined
again into one group amidst shrieks of excitement. The
young women repeated their dance. Their light steps
sedate, their backs and shoulders held straight and their
heads haughty and graceful. And as they sang, the young
men leapt to the centre. They jumped high into the air
each one of them vying to outdo the other.

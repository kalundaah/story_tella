blood relations whatsoever not to have relationship
contrary to their wishes. These should have disappeared

"Oh, my! I didn't know that you hold such strong
views on the Nasila culture," Joseph Parmuat said
chuckling. "In any case, you cannot say our culture has
been static. It has already shed off many negative aspects
some of which were obnoxious, such as the tradition of
throwing the dead and the dying to the hyenas, or the
inhuman tradition of abandoning the very old and
terminally ill people in deserted homestead to be
disembowelled by wild animals. That was ghastly,
wasn't it?"

"Yes, those traditions were certainly ghastly."
Resian said vehemently. "They were as obnoxious as
F.G.M is obnoxious today. If I had power, I would
constitute a committee that would go through all the
known culture with a fine tooth comb and consign all the
bad and negative ones to the dustbin of history."

"If one did that," said Joseph Parmuat knotting
his brows to show the seriousness in which he
considered the matter, "that person would be as
tyrannical and despotic as the old Olarinkoi was."

"Okay, okay! Let us agree that Nasila culture will
soon shed itself of F.G.M," Resian said

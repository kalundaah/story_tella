that her daughters did not expect their parents to lead
them back through a dark alley, to a retrogressive world
of excruciating pain and turmoil. The last thing she
would have wished on her daughters was mental torture.
Although she knew how difficult it was to change her
husband's mind, the least she could do for them was to
prepare a soft landing against what appeared to be an
inevitable eventuality.

When they finally got up and went to the living
room, Mama Milanoi and her husband found a clean,
tidy and well arranged room, far from its appearance the
night before. Heavy velvet curtains fluttered lazily in the
still fresh air of the morning. Taiyo was busy ferrying
breakfast from the kitchen to the table, while Resian,
fragile and pretty in her velvet and lace morning gown,
slumped in an armchair, her nose as always buried in a
book; reading.

"Look at that daughter of yours," Ole Kaelo told
his wife irritably. "While Taiyo works herself to the bone,
she lazes about like an over-fed lizard in the hot
afternoon sun."

"Resian-ai," her mother called fondly. "Would
you pease ..."

"Would you sit up straight like a respectable
girl," her father cut in sharply. "Look at the way you
slouch and slump in that chair like a good for nothing
lout! I'll not be surprised if you soon become a
hunchback!"

"Do sit up straight child," her mother added, with
a sudden sharp petulance. "Don't get your father angry
early in the morning."

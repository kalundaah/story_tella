When Joseph Parmuat came in that afternoon,
Taiyo enquired about Olarinkoi. In his usual jocular
manner, he first roared with hearty laughter. Then he
asked her whether any of them had fallen in love with
him. Taiyo joined in the cheerful laughter interjecting to
say it was much easier to fall in love with a creepy cold

"Which of the two do you want to know about?" he
asked in his usually humorous way. "Don't ask me if
they are related, for I have no idea."

"Tell me about the two," said Taiyo cheerfully,
curiosity taking the better of her. "Hope the one who
lived more than one hundred and fifty years ago did not

chuckled, tickled by Tatyo's comic description. "The
older fellow is more defined than the one we know
physically."

"Tell me about the one we know physically," she
said excitedly, her anticipation of an exciting story firing

legendary one later."

said he was of Ilukumae clan and came from a place
called Polonga, about two hundred kilometers from
Nasila. Another who thought he knew him better

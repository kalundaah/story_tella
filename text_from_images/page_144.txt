related and who are not. We are slotted among those
who cannot marry."

"No, it can't be, I cannot accept its verdict," she
said petulantly her words agonised. "No way, never!"
She stopped, confused and angry with herself at her
inarticulate outburst. She took several long steadying
breaths and then said, "I cannot accept that a culture that
does not feed, clothe, or house me comes to control my
life. Our lives belong to us, Joseph. The destiny of our
lives is in our own hands. We should guard it jealously."

At last they drew a little apart. His eyes were
open, honest and steady upon her face.

"I have also made up my mind, here and then,"
he said with exhilaration. He closed his eyes, took a deep
slow breath and said with a trembling emotional voice. "I
am too, ready to face any eventuality that may arise out
of our love for one another."

"Thank you," she whispered and her tears began
to overflow again. Her warm delicate fingers gripped his
firmly as she said excitedly, "I knew all along that, you
too couldn't throwaway something so special. I do not
care what others might think. We knew it right from the
beginning and we know it now that something so
wonderful cannot be wrong. We must, however, initially
be careful not to hurt others, especially Papaai, but
eventually it will be inevitable that we reveal our love to
everyone. After all, we cannot love in darkness forever,
can we?" He said nothing to that.

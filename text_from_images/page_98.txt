man would not stay. "No one knows what time he might
come back."

"No, I'll rather wait," he said confidently. "I am
very sure your father would be very happy to find me
here." As if he had just remembered something, he
cleared his throat and told her importantly, "By the way,
my name is Oloisudori. Yes Mr. Edward Oloisudori
Loonkiyaa.". He waited for a moment, obviously
expecting her to recognise those important names.
Seeing that she did not react to the mention of the names,
he said again insistently, "just wait until you see how
happy Ole Kaelo will be when he finds me waiting for
him in his house." Suddenly, his voice becoming softer
and almost intimate, he whispered, "I'll be happy to tell
him what a hospitable daughter he has." "Who else is
here in the house?"

"My mother," Resian answered nonchalantly.

"Perhaps you will tell her that I am here to see
your father."

"T'll do ..." Resian said impatiently as she stepped
back. But before she could complete her statement, he
had brushed past her in one swift movement that nearly
caught her off-balance. In a flash, he had pushed his way
into the living room and as he passed by her, she
certainly felt the fingers of his lifted hand graze the
fullness of her breast. With a surge of outraged
embarrassment, she glared at him viciously. She
muttered inaudibly, "what an ill-mannered devil this man
is!" And as she fled to the kitchen she felt those black
eyes, sharp and probing, moving like creepy fingers
upon her back.

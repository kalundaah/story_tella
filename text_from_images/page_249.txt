in rapid sequences and periods of light and darkness
flickered by in a dizzying swirl.

The first day the lucid memory came, she
realised that she was alone in the room and bright
sunlight flooded in through the doorway. It was hot in
there and she was naked, sweat forming and trickling
down her face and the side of her body. That was when
she realised that there was someone else in the room
apart from her. For a moment, terror returned to haunt
her. Was it Olarinkoi who had come back to torture her?
She turned her head slowly, and her eyes were met by a
kind stare from an old woman.

Their eyes met and held, and Resian recalled
faintly the motherly figure that had been nursing her.
Was it a dream replayed in her mind from the days of her
infancy or was it the fever playing its cruel games in her
mind? But she vaguely recalled the presence of an old
woman in that room, who resembled her mother or her
Yeiyo-botorr. She recalled her talking to her kindly
asking her how she felt. At times she held her up, giving
her drinks of water, or milk, or feeding her; putting bits
of olpurda dipped in honey into her mouth, or pounded
pieces of mutton and ugali and urging her to swallow.
Yes, she was certain that a woman had been in that room.
And now, there she was standing beside the bed.

"Who are you, kind mother?" Resian asked
weakly, aware that those were the first words that she
had uttered in along time.

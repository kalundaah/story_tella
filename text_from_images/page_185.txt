CHAPTER THIRTEEN

Edward Oloisudori Loonkiyaa had ambushed
them again. He had promised to go for Resian in two
weeks but he abruptly changed his mind; he would pick
her up the following day. He was going to be
accompanied by three important friends and he
specifically wanted Resian to cook for them.

The message sent panic into the hearts of Ole
Kaelo and his wife. They had been dilly dallying for a
long time unable to find the best way to approach Resian
and break the news to her. At last, their procrastination
had caught up with them.

Taiyo and Resian had been to the practice room
where Joseph Parmuat had been coaching Taiyo in song
and dance. Resian had sat reading. At the end of the
coaching, Taiyo had gone straight to the bathroom to
take a shower and change. Resian sauntered into the
living room where her parents sat in the overstuffed
armchairs set in the corner near a warm charcoal brazier.
Her father was reading an old newspaper which he set
aside when she entered.

"Ne-yeiyo-ai nanyorr" he called her pleasantly,
his voice warm and cordial.

"Yeoo,"she answered, greatly surprised by her
father's use of the pleasant diminutive reserved only for
the person one loved very much. The determinedly
pleasant tone raised an eyebrow.

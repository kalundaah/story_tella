happen. In those old good days, had her husband tried to
enforce such an abomination, she would have appealed
to the elders court which certainly would have ruled him
out of order and possibly fined him together with his
purported son-in-law. A public rebuke and an ensuing
cleansing ceremony conducted by the fearsome oloiboni
would have shamed the culture-abusers and_ their

Culture gave her room to call for mass action.
Mass action was swift, vindictive and decisive. And it
was most feared by men. It was rarely activated, but
when it was, it paralyzed all activities in the homesteads.

years old. A mannerless old man got infatuated with a
fourteen-year-old daughter of his age-mate. The randy
old man followed the girl everywhere she went. He
followed her to the river when she went to draw water,
and to the bushes, when she went to fetch firewood. He

glimpse of her when she was milking. One day, he
became bold enough and seduced her as she milked her
mother's cows. The girl was infuriated and reported the
incident to her mother.

"In Nakuru, this was not a subject that concerned
us much. But in Nasila, it is on every lip."

"Yes, that's very true," Resian said trying to
entice her mother to say more. "The other day Taiyo
learnt from Joseph Parmuat that female circumcision
was initiated by women themselves about two hundred
years earlier. And that it was as a result of sexual abuse
and harassment by an invading despot called Olarinkoi
and his warriors. Is that true, Yeiyo? I thought it was one
of those myths that were created by men to blame
women for everything that works against them."

"What Joseph Parmuat told Taiyo is factually
correct," her mother told her confidently. "It was the
shame and anger that was provoked by Ilarinkon taunts,
lewd teasing and provocative posturing that made the
women do what they did to curtail those desires the
worthless predators exploited to prey upon them."
"That may have been true then;' Resian said looking
directly into her mother's eyes. "But what is the reason
for doing it today? Ilarinkon are no longer with us, or are
they?"

"The original Ilarinkon may have gone," her
mother said unconvincingly, "but other Ilarinkon are still
with us."

"Exactly!" said Resian triumphantly. "Yes, it's
the latter day Ilarinkon who are wreaking havoc on us
women. Surely Yeivo, if one discovered a nasty but
potent medicine that once taken cured an ailment, must
they continue to swallow it every day - ten years down
the line. I find that absurd. The sensible thing would be
to discard the bitter medicine once people are cured.
Period! Tell me Yeiyo, what use is F.G.M to today's

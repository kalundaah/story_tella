By then, her father had folded his newspaper and
was now busy folding his glasses - putting them into
their leather case. That done, he placed the leather case
neatly upon the folded newspaper. "Yes, my dear child."

From the kitchen came the loud voices of Resian
and their mother as they argued about something. Taiyo
saw her father turn his head and cock it to that direction,
listening. She knew she had lost his attention. "I am
sorry my child, what were you saying?"

"I was just saying," Taiyo hesitated and noting
that her father's thoughts were no longer with her, gave
up the idea of speaking to him that night about the
university. She hoped there would be another chance
soon. "I was just wishing you a good night."

"Yes, of course," he said absentmindedly. "Good
night my dear."

And as she left the room, her father called back and said.
"Please call Resian for me."

That alarmed Resian but strangely, the alarm
turned into optimism. As she quickly walked to the
living room where their father was still seated, she felt
optimistic: glad tidings had finally come. Either their
mother had successfully argued their case before their
father and he had finally consented to their request to
enroll at Egerton University, or her sister Taiyo had at
last done it. Oh, wonderful sister Tatyo! She was still
replaying those pleasurable words when she reached
where her father was seated.

painfully between her teeth. Why, in God's name, she
asked herself, did Oloisudori have to insist that she must
be there when he and his friends ate their lunch? She
shook her head fiercely. She could not do it, she would
not do it, she declared.

She walked to an oloponi tree at the centre of the
garden. Finding a log underneath it, she sank down on it
her shoulders drooping, her knees drawn to her breasts
and her arms folded upon them. She sat so for a long
time, shivering in the gnawing cold, staring into the
darkness. In a helpless gesture of unhappiness she bowed
her head, resting her forehead on her arms, and went into
serious reflection on what her father was forcing her to
do.

She did not believe him when he said Oloisudori
had chosen her over Taiyo, to prepare lunch for him. She
did not believe that. She knew her father despised her
ever since she was young. She wondered what he
disliked so much about her. Was it her fault? Her father
would never provoke Taiyo the way he constantly
provoked her. He would never rebuke, scold or ridicule
Taiyo the way he repeatedly did it to her. She thought he
was now going a step further to make her an adjunct to
his enterprise whose only purpose was to entertain his
business associates, such as Oloisudori and his friends.
Had her father respected her feelings, he would have
listened to her when she said she did not like Oloisudori.

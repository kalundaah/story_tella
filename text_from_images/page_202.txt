obvious. But seeing her father's face cloud, she added
quickly. "Who between them spoke to you about our
enrolment at the Egerton University?"

"What are you talking about, child?" her father
who seemed dumbfounded, asked after a long and
uncomfortable silence.

"Both Yeiyo and Taiyo promised to talk to you
about it, and I thought she had."

"What, in the name of God are you talking about,
child?" he repeated, this time agitated and shaking his
head vigorously. "No, I have never spoken to anybody
about any of you enrolling at the university. Never!
When I said I wanted us to discuss your future, that isn't
what I meant at all. Of course nod" Resian looked at her
father's face enquiringly.

"I was going to tell you ..." he hesitated and then
stopped. His usual irritation and short temper reasserted
themselves. "Never mind what I was going to say. For
heavenâ€™s sake, Resian, go back to the kitchen. I'll talk to
you another day. Ask your mother to come here
immediately!"

The sound of his tone carried a definite finality.

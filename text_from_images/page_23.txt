Resian and nudged her to change direction. But the man
walked directly to Taiyo. On seeing the man
approaching, a heavy knobkerry in his hand, Resian
almost fainted.

"Please do not harm us," she pleaded. "We do not
have any money with us."

"Who told you I want any money?" the man
jeered as he strode menacingly towards them. "Are you
not the intoiye nemengalana from Nakuru town?" he
asked laughing contemptuously. "I want to have a good
look at you and know what kind of stuff you are made
of!" He roughly grabbed Tatyo's arm.

"Leave my _ sister alone!" Resian hissed
indignantly lifting her eyes and glaring into his. "Let go
her arm at once!"

"Let go of my hand," Taiyo demanded, trembling
with anger. "We are not the kind of women you have in
mind!"

"What women!" the man retorted acidly. "Soon,
you will be able to differentiate decent women from
intoiye nemengalana."

Taiyo tried to wrestle her arm from the man's
grip without success. But suddenly, he seemed to change
his mind. With a sour smile, he spat and glared at the
girls. Then, releasing Taiyo's hand, he told them: "You
have not seen the last of me. Soon you will come to
know that there is no place in our society for women of
your ilk." He turned and disappeared down the road as
suddenly as he had appeared.

The two girls sighed heavily and shook their
heads as they watched him walk away. Although they
had put up brave faces, they were terribly shaken.

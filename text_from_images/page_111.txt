us. Other than those little changes, everything else is just
fine."

"What are those little things, Papaai?" asked
Taiyo inquisitively, her eyes staring at him fixedly.

"Nothing serious," he said getting impatient.
"And whatever they are, know that your father is in
control. Now join your mother and Resian in the kitchen
and make sure food is ready soon. I would like to retire
to bed early today."

When the girls went to the kitchen they were
surprised by their mother's aloofness. Her absent-
mindedness that evening had already made her burn and
ruin the rice that was to be their evening meal. Her
daughters tried to charm her, tease her, prod her, provoke
her without much success. Had her taciturnity anything
to do with Oloisudori's visit? If that was the case, they
reasoned, then, the demonic extortionist's visit was
outrageously ruinous.

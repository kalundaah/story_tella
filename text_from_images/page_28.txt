he know that his friend was much more advanced when
it came to the murky business of the underworld.

"I hope all is well with your business
arrangements," Supeyo commented nonchalantly.

"Everything is moving on smoothly," said Ole
Kaelo contentedly. "I hope to open the doors of the shop
at the onset of the rains."

"Good," said Supeyo cheerfully. "You will soon
find out that, unlike in Agribix where somebody else
provides the finances, another does the books, yet
another runs up and down making sales, you will have to
carryall those tasks single-handedly. And sales will be
the most challenging."

Ole Kaelo's pride was wounded. How could the
old fellow think he was so naive as not to know how to
organise his sales? Perhaps, he thought sourly, his
clansmate had not known that in his earlier years in
Agribix, he had been sent out to open sales depots in
remote places which he quickly developed into
expanding profitable modern branches. Maybe it was
time he showed the ageing businessman that younger
bulls were raring to go and the old ones would better
start skirting the pastures. He threw caution to the wind.

"The sales are already taken care of," Ole Kaelo
said pompously. "Sales of about three hundred thousand
bags of fertilizer, half a million bags of seeds plus
insecticides, fungicides and herbicides are as good as
bagged and secured. You see that?"

"My goodness," Supeyo exclaimed. "How did
you manage such a feat?"

family colour photograph; taken when the girls were still
young. Everything was neat and well-ordered. Without
much explanation the girls knew it was their father's
office.

It was while they were in Ole Kaelo's
comfortable office that Mama Milanoi revealed their
father's consent to Taityo's request to be coached by
Joseph Parmuat. Taiyo was enthralled.

That evening when they got home, Joseph
Parmuat visited them. The moment he appeared at their
door, the three Ole Kaelo women instantly liked him: his
broad smile, his hearty chuckle, his uproarious rich
pearls of laughter and his unbridled sense of humor were
some of his most endearing qualities.

When Joseph Parmuat entered their house, she
stood back and watched as he was immediately drawn
into the small intimate circle of their mother's attention.
The girls had always known that their mother had an
adroitness that made any man who approached her a part
of that charming world of hers. Seeing how their mother
monopolized him Taiyo could not, for a moment,
suppress a surge of envy. Of course she knew the envy
was misplaced, for only recently, since the advent of her
own womanhood, had she begun to understand her
mother and herself. And even Resian, the ever gloomy
pessimist of the Kaelo family, was laughing and talking
excitedly beside their mother, looking up teasingly into
the face of their newly acquired brother. It seemed as if
the three Ole Kaelo women had hatched a female
conspiracy, of which Joseph Parmuat seemed to be
enjoying tremendously, as any man would.

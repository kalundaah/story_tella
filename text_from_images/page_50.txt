her family as to perform in public in exchange of
monetary gain. It was one thing to perform in a school
festival, he reasoned, but to perform to a public gallery
was one short step to harlotry. No amount of persuasion
would change her father's mind.

She knew without any doubt in her heart that she
still loved music. It was in her blood. How she wished
she would meet that young man who coached those
young children to sing and perform so well.

It was not until three in the afternoon that the
carnival mood that had been getting merrier by the hour,
exploded into a frenzied celebration. The exultant crowd
in the homestead broke into an exciting rhythm of song
and dance. Taiyo and Resian, who by then had retreated
into the shadow of a spreading o/oponi tree, from where
they watched the colourful movement of the throng of
dancers, could not resist the urge to join them. They
quickly stepped into the crowd and began to dance. And
so did their mother who, tugging their aunt, Yeiyoo-
botorr also joined other dancers who were already
heaving their chests forward and backward as they
chanted the refrain. Before long, they spotted their three
other aunts who too were amongst the crowd of dancers.
Uncle Simiren was there too, dancing, his bald head
shining like a piece of iron sheet in the afternoon sun.
Then they saw their father.

"Look at Papaai!, said Taiyo giggling as she
pointed out their father amidst a group of dancing elders.

"He doesn't seem to know how to dance,"
commented Resian jokingly and _ then added
mischievously. "He should ask uncle Simiren to coach
him."

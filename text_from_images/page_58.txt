After that voluble curse, the old man blessed the
Ole Kaelos. He had a special blessing for the daughter of
Ole Kaelo who served him with a special dish that
evening. He prophesied that she will be a mother of the
next leader of Nasila and Maa.

When Parsimei Ole Kaelo later learnt that the
daughter mentioned by the seer was Taiyo, he was elated.
But Mama Milanoi was troubled. What she feared for
her daughters was turning to be real Taiyo and Resian
also felt troubled. They felt squeamish as they stood
there, their downcast eyes riveted upon the floor, fear
and hopelessness tormenting their young hearts. But who
was that person, they wondered, who was referred to as a
‘wasp’ and who evoked so much virulent hatred amongst
the people of Nasila?

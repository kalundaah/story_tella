monkeys. Then there was a sinuous movement along the
ground by the second tree as the man there disappeared
into another bush.

The other men got interested with what Ole
Kaelo was studying and they stealthily began to encircle
the trees where the men hid. By then, there was an open
space of about fifteen or so metres between the trees in
which the two men hid. Two old men advanced towards
the group.

Suddenly and without warning, the two men
darted from the bushes in a lightning speed across the
open space. The thirty men together with Ole Kaelo and
Joseph Parmuat sprinted murderously from the bushes
and hotly pursued the two with their weapons high up in
the air ready to strike deadly blows.

The two old men walking towards the group saw
the thirty armed men running towards them with swords
and knobkerries, and got alarmed. They stopped and
stared confusedly. The happenings dawned on them
when the young men, who seemed to be fleeing from
mortal danger, fell at their feet and hugged their legs
pleading for intercession. When the old men hesitated,
the two cried more, pushing themselves underneath the
old men's clothing between their legs. But before any
pleading could take place, they had been clobbered and
were bleeding profusely.

"Aatulutoiye, Papaai!" one young man fearfully
pleaded.

culture but that left a sour taste in his mouth. No, Nasila
culture was too valuable to be abandoned. It gave him

the father and mother that brought up and nurtured its
children to maturity. Nasila culture was too valuable and
too important to be abandoned in exchange of a woman's
love. But was Taiyo just another woman? He searched
and searched his heart again. At the end, it was the
wisdom of Maa that prevailed. Its founder had said a
man could never run away from his clan and his age-set.
He declined her love.

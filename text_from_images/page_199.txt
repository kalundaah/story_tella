accustomed place. "He can really be generous, eh?"
"Most certainly he is."

"Did he take part in funding our shop?" she
continued and rued it immediately for she noticed he was
getting irritated.

"Yes, but why do you ask?" he snapped showing
signs of a rising temper.

"Nothing, Papaai," Taiyo answered quickly
trying to avert an oncoming clash. "I just thought we
should know so that we can in future treat him with the
respect he deserves."

"Good!" he said with finality and picked up his
glass, tipped and drained off its content in one quick
gulp.

Taiyo hesitated. Now that she had failed to get
any information from her father, she thought she could
try another line. From the day they came back from their
uncle's home, she and Resian had been waiting for their
mother to tell them what their father's response had been
regarding their request to be allowed to go back to
Nakuru to enroll as students at the Egerton University.
Over the past few weeks, Resian irritating sulks
notwithstanding, Taiyo knew her conscience had not
been entirely clear. She had on several occasions
promised her sister that she would speak to their father,
but she had never come round to doing so.

"Papaai," she called him pleasantly.

his visitor. Taiyo and Resian stepped back to allow
Oloisudori through. He greeted Taiyo politely and
smiled at Resian confidently as if to suggest that a bond
between them had been established and their familiarity
was now a matter of mutual understanding. Resian
dropped her gaze to the floor.

"There goes the monster," Resian hissed angrily
through clenched teeth, as her father and Oloisudori
walked down the steps. "He's the devil incarnate!"
Bearing in mind what Joseph Parmuat told us about him,
Taiyo said nonchalantly. "Olosudori could very easily
pass as just another innocent Nasila elder."

"God forbid," Resian hissed, her lips tightening
dangerously. Just the sight of Oloisudori had revived the
loathing she had for him. "I pray that God will never
give him a chance to pass as an innocent Nasila elder."

Just then, their father returned. Resian looked at
him and perceived something queer about him. She was
alarmed. Did she imagine it or was there something
unnatural about him? She wondered. And what was it?
Her father looked at her and quickly averted his eyes and
looked elsewhere. She noticed that something was amiss.
She felt very certain there was something awful in the air.

"Resian, go to the kitchen and help your mother
prepare supper," her father said sharply. "And make it
snappy!" The look on her father's face immobilized her.
She glanced at him curiously. He was watching her too,
his wrinkled face unsmiling. She then regained her
composure and was about to go when once again
something in his face made her hesitate for a moment,
thinking he was about to say something more to her.

mother's mood was completely different. Her previous
night's taciturnity had turned into loquacity.

When their father later turned up for breakfast, he
was edgy and his eyes were shifty. It was only when they
told him what had befallen them the previous day that he
was shocked back to his senses. He got agitated and
angrily gnashed his teeth. He hit the table top with his
clenched fist, rattling the crockery on it. He shouted in a
thunderous booming voice saying an assault on his
daughters was not only an affront to him personally that
he could not tolerate but a threat to the security of his
children and home that he could never ever allow to
surface as long as he lived. Getting up suddenly, he
briskly walked back to their bedroom. Their mother who
was equally shocked and angered by the depressing news,
followed her husband. The girls were left there
crestfallen. | Despondency and  downheartedness
alternated in their young hearts wreaking untold havoc in
their already troubled lives.

Melancholy turned into fear when the girls saw
their father re-emerge from the bedroom armed with a
sword and knobkerrie. His eyes glittered with fury and
his face turned ashen with combat. His mouth frothed
and trembled as he murmured expletives. With long
angry strides, he walked out of the house in a huff
banging the door behind him. The girls were left
wringing their hands and biting their fingernails with
grief and apprehension.

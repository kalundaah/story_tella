clan about him. Elders had termed reckless his decision
to remain married to only one wife, who had only borne
him two daughters. They had likened him to a mono-
eyed giant who stood on legs of straw. Parsimei had got
angry and called the clan elders megalomaniacs who
were still trapped in archaic traditions that were better
buried and forgotten. Simiren did not argue with him
then nor would he do so now. He would rather have
matters take their own course.

There was, however, a more sensitive matter that
had not been broached; it had to do with his daughters.
He had hardly given thought to their age earlier, but
when he saw them that evening he knew they should
have left home long ago. It would take not long before
his brother earned himself the derogatory name of the
father of intoiye nemengalana.

shuddered when she thought of those shamelessly
questing eyes. Was there no better man that her father
could find to do business with? Then she remembered
her sister Taiyo and the promise to speak to their father.
"Oh, my God," she exclaimed to herself excitedly, "I'm
standing here foolishly thinking of Oloisudori's stupid
antics, while I could actually be on my way to the
university!" She felt sure Taiyo had spoken to their
father and possibly he had already consented. She
stood quite still for a moment. She was enthralled. Then
she quickly walked round the house and got back to the
front.

As she walked to the gate, she saw her sister
sitting on a log next to Joseph Parmuat. One look at her
sister's face, and Resian was sure things did not click.
She hoped that her father had not rejected Taiyo's
proposal to take them to the university. She wanted to
remain hopeful Her fear was to have the door shut
permanently on them.

Taiyo knew her sister's expectation. As soon as
Resian got to where they were seated, she explained to
her, how she tried, without success, to talk to their father.
She had hoped to find him alone and in an agreeable
mood, but all that had proven difficult.

Strangely, for the first time, she found Resian
understanding. Instead of getting sulky, as she often did,
she said she had appreciated her sister's effort and that
she was happy the door was still open. She was sure an
opportune time would offer itself, and at that time, she
believed, divine powers would have prevailed upon their
father. She was that optimistic.

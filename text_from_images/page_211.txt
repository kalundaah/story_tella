between his knees and forcefully open its mouth and
tuck its mother's teat into it. He would then squeeze out
the milk into the kid's mouth. The taste of the milk
would make it suckle and removal of the teat from its
mouth would be a struggle.

"So would be Resian," Ole Kaelo concluded
triumphantly. "When she sees what you have laid out for
her pleasures, she would rebuke herself for her
procrastination in the first place."

To cap it all, Oloisudori had given Ole Kaelo and
his wife his four-wheel-drive and a driver to take them
back to Nasila. Mama Milanoi sat in her corner of the
back seat appreciating with awe the leather upholstered
interior of the vehicle. She then turned her head to look
out of the window, her mind and her heart in a turmoil.

Although she had laughed with her husband and
with Oloisudori, the plan to ensnare her daughter like an
antelope left a feeling of betrayal in her heart. Truly, the
riches were in plenty, she argued to herself, but should
not Resian be persuaded to accept them rather than being
ensnared into them? The idea of ensnaring her daughter
in a web like a spider did with a fly, did not appeal to her
at all.

It was different for her husband. He felt on top of
the world as he sat comfortably at his left corner of the
immaculate vehicle. A happy mood pervaded his heart. It
was a feeling of satisfaction and achievement.

"Tea is not very important to me," he said
pleasantly and added softly, "there are many things I
know you want to know about our future. Oh, yes. Many
things."

"What do you mean by our future," Resian asked
petrified by his words.

"Don't be ridiculous, Resian," Oloisudori said his
large eyes narrowing a little. "Must we repeat what is
obvious, my dear? But if I may say, you will never regret
taking the decision you have taken. You will be the
happiest lady in the whole of East Africa!"

"What are you talking about, Sir?" Resian asked
trying to learn a little bit more.

"What I mean, is simply this," he said slowly like
one talking to an obstinate child. "When you are married
to me and you are settled in your palatial home at the
Milimani Estate in Nakuru, you will be exceedingly
happy!"

She stared at him speechlessly. His words did not
at first make sense to her. But slowly it dawned on her
that her father had already sold her. Yes, the briefcase
that was handed to him contained her dowry money.
What that meant was that, she was literally Oloisudori's
slave. She was his playing thing. And as if to confirm
her fears, he stood up and began to walk towards her
saying, "Our fate with you Resian is sealed. You can
never escape. You are my wife and only death shall part
us. You hear me, eh?"

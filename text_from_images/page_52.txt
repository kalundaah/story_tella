hearts gladdened. Soon after, the party gathered
momentum and voices rose. Within no time, one could
hardly be heard over the hubbub of talk and laughter.
And as the pleasurable and lively celebration progressed,
voices became animated; hands and arms gesticulated
vigorously while heads turned more often. Eyes searched
out acquaintances within the throng of revelers.

And it was all pomp and gaiety as ivory adorned
and bejeweled fingers fluttered; bare shoulders gleamed
in the light; multi-coloured bead ornaments glittered
upon elaborately bedecked necks; pendulous ilmiintoni
of all colours dangled loosely down extended ear-lobes;
and the bright colours of lesos, kangas, red shukas and
multicolored blankets, all turned the Ole Kaelo living
room into a kaleidoscope of shifting light and colour.

That evening, Mama Milanoi, the perfect hostess,
was a woman with glamour. She was resplendently
dressed in purple silk and moved happily from one group
to the other talking cheerfully: her laughter ringing out
pleasantly. That was her home and that was her evening.
She had to make sure that no one present in that living
room would leave with any shred of doubt in his or her
heart as to who was the enopeny enkang of the Ole
Kaelo homestead.

Taiyo was watching with amusement as_ her
mother moved from one group of revellers to another
when suddenly her eye caught sight of a tall man who
was advancing across the room towards her direction.
She recognised him and her heart missed a _ beat.
Momentarily, his bright eyes met hers. They were
perfectly set on a young and handsome face that was
above an equally impressive attire of red shukas.

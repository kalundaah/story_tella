extravaganza. She had stubbornly put up a spirited
struggle but the battle was so predictably and utterly lost.
That had left a wound in her heart that was still too raw
to probe. Her rage, she realised, was still seething within
her. The simple faith and certainty of childhood upon
which her life until then had been found, had failed her.
Also, her trust that her father would give her whatever
she requested for had been badly shaken.

Stemming those thoughts out of her mind, she
raised her head and looked through the morning sun
beams that gleamed brightly across the rooftops of
Nakuru town; that beloved town that was the mother of
all flamingos. A town that she was now about to leave.
Tears welled in her eyes. She blinked suddenly and
rapidly.

Taiyo did not hear her younger sister Resian
approach. Briefly and in silence, they stood by the
window side by side in the empty room. As far back as
the two sisters could remember, they had always stood
by that window every Sunday morning before they went
to church. But their little habit of observing what went
on below the streets of the town was made poignant that
morning; it was going to be the last time they would do
this.

Resian leaned forward and lifted her face to look
into her sister's large, brown eyes. She spoke very softly
but her words were distinct and her voice very clear in
the silent empty room.

"Taiyo- e - yelyo, what do you think life is going
to be like in Nasila?"

"For heaven's sake, Resian," Taiyo said, turning
round to face her sister. "How am I supposed to know?"

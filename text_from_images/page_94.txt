CHAPTER SEVEN

Resian was still waiting for her sister to speak to
their father over their enrolment at the Egerton
University. It had been a frustrating long wait, but she
was still optimistic that sooner or later, her sister would
catch their father in an agreeable mood. She had given
up on her mother who, after several attempts to draw her
into their scheme, had proved to be cleverly evasive.

On that particular day, Resian was overly
optimistic. That morning, Taiyo had left for the shop in
the company of their father. She had excitedly promised
Resian that if all went well, she would definitely bring
up the subject of their enrolment at Egerton University.
So, as she worked with her mother in the kitchen,
Resian's heart warmed up with pleasant expectations.
She let her spirit float fleetingly into the fanciful world
of beautiful things. That was the world of yote
yawezekana, a popular song of the day that cooed to say,
all things were possible. In her mind, she imagined
herself already admitted at the university and walking
majestically with other students into one of those
awesome lecture theatres, while donning her academic
regalia. Her reverie was, however, cut short by her
mother's introduction of a subject she least expected her
to broach.

"My daughter," she called unexpectedly, while
stirring her pot of ugali. "Have you ever heard of
something called F.G.M?"

"Female Genital Mutilation? Why, yes, not only
have I heard of it," Resian replied her eyes wide open
with surprise. "I know about it. Why do you ask?"

judged, and were up to then still appreciated. The legend
described the girl as so charmingly beautiful that she
caused the morans to traverse the vast, dry and hot plains
of Susua all the way to Mosiro, where the girl lived with
her parents, just to have a glimpse of her beauty. It was
said that the morans on seeing her, would stand in a daze
staring fixedly at her. They would drink in the subtlety
of her beauty: her baby face with those bewitching
dimples on her cheeks, her white pearl-like teeth planted
on black gums, and that captivating natural gap called
enchilaloi that prettily sat conspicuously between her
upper front teeth. She was said to be petite, had a narrow
waist and long shapely legs. Her large languorous eyes
were said to sap energy from the knees of those to whom
she directed her glance, incapacitating them at once. All
those besotted with her love could not help but sing in
unison:

Entito nanyokie naitudungo - Brown girl who caused
Ilmurran Susua - Morans to traverse Susua.

Oloisudori thought Resian was like that girl and
more. She was also like the famous English lady whose
love besotted a great legendary gentleman called Lord
Ngata. In fact, Oloisudori thought he and Lord Ngata
could have been birds of the same feather. What he
learned of the great settler, he thought, put him shoulder
to shoulder with him.

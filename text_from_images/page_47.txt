Taiyo and Resian who had joined the throng of
spectators were ecstatic. Their eyes were glued to the
handsome, arrogant athletic figures of the morans. One
particular young man caught Tatyo's eye. He was lithe,
tall and dark-haired in red shukas, who leapt higher with
more grace than the rest. She involuntarily gasped, her
gaze still riveted upon his handsome face.

"Look at that young man," Taiyo told her sister,
excitedly pointing at him." Isn't he handsome?"

Resian followed her sister's gaze. "Yes, he is,"
she said trying to scrutinize his face from that distance.
"He is undoubtedly good-looking."

Even as they gazed at the young man, he broke
out of the group and walked out of the gate. Moments
later he came back leading a group of uniformed school
children, boys and girls who he quickly arranged into
four short lines, one following the other. Soon the air
was resonant with their vibrant voices as they sang an
exciting heart-lifting song, whose words had been
carefully selected to commemorate Ole Kaelo's return.

Teninining iltualan loo nkishu ang, - If you listen to the
tinkling bells of our cattle,

Niyolou tenaa naapuo linka ashu nar ukunye ang.
- You will know whether the cattle are going out to
pastures, or on their way back home.

Tenaa napuo linka, shomo taanyu tenaituyupaki -
If they are on their way to the pastures, wait for them, at
the hills of Naituyupaki

Tenaa narukunye ang, taanyu te kishomi Ole
Kaelo. - If thry are streaming back home, wait for them
at the homestead of Ole Kaelo.

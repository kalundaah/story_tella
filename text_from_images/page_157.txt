of that big-bodied hooligan zooming before her eyes as
he tried to drag her into the bushes. She was determined
to take the first available opportunity to persuade their
father to let them return to Nakuru and enroll at the
university. After all, she reasoned, both of them had
attained the required qualifications and all they needed
was the enrolment at the university and a sponsor.

Their parents looked tired, and aloof when they
arrived home. Their father immediately removed his
shoes, slumped into a chair and stared at the ceiling
unblinkingly. Their mother went straight into their
bedroom and did not come out. For reasons they did not
know, Olarinkoi did not return after that afternoon's
incident. Joseph Parmuat too did not turn up. The girls
had to keep their horrific story, however urgent, to
themselves until their parents had recovered from
whatever was troubling them.

And they were truly troubled. Ole Kaelo's
mission to Ole Supeyo had backfired. He had hoped,
being his friend and mentor, to persuade him to take over
all those stocks in his godowns that he had secured on
the strength of those contracts that Oloisudori had
enabled him sign with the parastatals. Had he accepted
the arrangement and paid off all his liabilities to the
banks, Ole Kaelo would have sneered at Oloisudori and
told him to keep his hands off his daughter Resian. But
Ole Supeyo had declined the offer effectively throwing
him back to the hyena.

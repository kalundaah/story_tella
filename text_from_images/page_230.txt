what I wanted to tell you the last time when I called you.
You are a lucky child, Resian. A very lucky child, dear
Resian." Resian stared at him. She already knew what he
was to say next.

"No," she said flatly.

"You are a very lucky child as I said," he
continued, ignoring her protest.

"I am delighted to tell you that my good friend
and business associate Oloisudori Loonkiyaa has
approached me asking that he marries you. You know he
is..."

At first she was stunned like one hit by a bolt of
lightning. Then suddenly she began to shout. She threw
her head back and screamed so loudly one would have
thought she was engulfed in a ball of fire. She hollered,
shrieked and shrilled, saying all sort of things to express
outrage. She cried, accusing her father of hatred and
betrayal by betrothing her to Oloisudori. Her father
stared at her in horror. But she would not stop, she
shouted even more and screamed like one possessed with
demented spirits. After a moment of frozen immobility,
her father suddenly pushed back his chair, moved fast
from behind the desk and slapped her face, sending her
reeling back so that she almost fell. She stared at him in
disbelief. He slapped her again backhanded.

"That should teach you never to talk like that to
your father," he said fuming, his nostrils flaring and his
eyes glittering with anger.

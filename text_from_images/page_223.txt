rejected them outrightly. The six who passed the test
were happily married to him.

He had thought Resian was going to be an
exception. He thought he was going to have a tough
struggle and he had come prepared for it. He was a little
disappointed though, for the anticlimax had lessened the
anticipated adventure. He called his driver, handed him
the carton and instructed him to take care of it for it
contained items of great value.

"I can't thank you and your sister for this kind
gesture," Oloisudori said happily. "Rest assured,
beautiful lady, that this will be repaid a million times.
Just wait and see."

He took Resian's hand and carried it to his lips
kissing her palm. His moustache was rough and wiry
against her sensitive skin. She shivered a little as she
opened her fingers, surrendering herself to the small
outrageous intimacy!

"Would you come in, please," she invited him cautiously
leading the way to the house. "My mother is in the house
and she has prepared tea and tasty pancakes for you."

"Thank you very much." He followed her into the
living room.

Hardly had they got in when the familiar
paralysing panic rose in her. The moment he took his
seat, his gaze deliberately dropped from her face to her
bosom and lingered there. She decided to ignore that
stupid look on his face excusing herself to bring his tea.

who was struggling with Resian on the ground. He
seized the front of his shirt and coat and jerked him to
his feet. He brought his right fist down in a powerful
blow, lifting himself to his toes and putting the strength
from his legs, back and arm behind his knuckles as they
crushed into the man's nose and mouth. Blood exploded
from the man's nose and mouth. He reeled across the
road and slammed into a tree trunk with a force that
shook the whole tree. He lay there motionless.

The stranger then took three quick steps and
caught up with the man who had been dragging Taiyo
into the bushes. The man tried to flee, but the stranger
caught him by the collar of his coat and yanked him back.
As he bounced back, the stranger drove his fist into the
man's stomach and he doubled over. He then brought
down his right fist and hit him on the side of his head.
Blood splattered onto the ground. He too slumped on the
ground writhing in pain.

It was then that the girls recognised their hero. It
was Olarinkoi. He did not talk or look at them. He stood
trembling with anger, breathing heavily, with his fists
clenched and looking down at the men who lay in a heap.
One of the men moved his limbs weakly and moaned
hoarsely as thick, heavy streams of blood trickled from
his nose and lips to the soil. Olarinkoi stepped forward,
lifted his foot and kicked him viciously on the ribs. The
man let out a loud yell and fell silent.

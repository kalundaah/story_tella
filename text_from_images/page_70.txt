Resian scowled her displeasure for being berated
but nevertheless closed her book and scurried back to
their bedroom.

Later in the day, Ole Kaelo took his wife and
daughters to Nasila stores, to show them their brand new
business. They were impressed and instantly liked it. The
shop had opened for business two days earlier and it was
already full of customers.

It was splendid, large and well stocked. The
decor was discreetly and fashionably done while taking
into consideration the kind of customers that were
expected. The mahogany and brass counters and display
cases gleamed. The display boards on the walls carried
all kinds of tools, accessories and fittings. The tiled floor
was polished to a shiny sheen while beveled and etched
glass and mirrors nailed on strategic pillars and walls
reflected every image and glint of light with sparkling
clarity. On a large float in the middle of the shop, a range
of dairy equipment was exhibited with masterly
craftsmanship; their superior quality complementing
perfectly the surroundings that had been created to
display them. There were milk pails, milk cans, buckets,
and cream separators. Beside them were animal feeds
and licks of all brands. Also displayed were herbicides,
insecticides, acaricides and fungicides.

Resian, eyeing the splendor with a rather
jaundiced eye, nudged her sister and whispered, "All
these must have cost Papaai a fortune. Need he have
done all this? I hope when you finally come round to
asking him to send us to the university, he will not say
he has spent all his money on this business premises and
the stock."

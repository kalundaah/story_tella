Back in the living room, Taiyo, Resian and their
mother began to speak at once. They spoke of its size,
convenience and the furniture fitting.

After a hurriedly prepared dinner, the girls retired
to their bedroom to arrange and tidy it up. Cartons of
their clothes, bedding, books and other personal effects
were still piled up on their unmade bed. Curtains were
yet to be hung as were their pictures and decorations.
Taiyo removed her cardigan and immediately swung into
action. She loosened the ropes that tied cartons, emptied
their contents onto the floor and sorted them. After some
time, the large room that held their big bed was in
shambles. Shoes lay strewn all over, books were stacked
in heaps on the floor and clothes and bedding were
scattered on the bed. Exhausted, she straightened up and
stood, hands on her hips, eyeing in growing exasperation
her sister who sat on a chair at one corner of the room
reading a book.

"Surely, Resian," she complained to her sharply.
"Is this the time to read a book with all this mess around
us?"

"Do your bit now and I will do mine tomorrow,"
Resian replied with a nonchalant carelessness. "I insist
that you get up right now and get to work" Taiyo raised
her voice. "We need to arrange this room before we get
to bed."

Resian grunted. She reluctantly laid the book
down and went to work.

They reviewed the events of the last two days as
they tried to bring order to the room.

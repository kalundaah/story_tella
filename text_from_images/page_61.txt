"Away with the barbaric culture," cried Taiyo
bitterly, "Away with the archaic way of life."

She wept until she had no more tears in her eyes,
then she sobbed dryly. Was there no guarantee of justice
in life? How could she come across the man who she
thought would have filled the void in her heart so
fittingly and instantly lose him to the ancient doubtful
ancestral links? She was angry with everybody in Nasila,
but more so with her uncle Simiren who she infuriatingly
blamed for ruining her relationship with Joseph Parmuat.

The mere mention of Joseph Parmuat's name
evoked delightful feelings that warmly excited her heart.
She wondered whether he too could be sleepless at that
very hour thinking of her. Did he know before that they
were of the same clan and, therefore, forbidden to have
any heterosexual links whatsoever? She thought the
gross unfairness of the outdated culture was definitely a
searing torment to her and to all others who were of
progressive minds.

But not all was lost though, she reasoned, a
flicker of hope lighting up her sorrowful heart. Within
the few minutes they had stood there in the living room,
Joseph Parmuat had made two promises: to visit her in
their home the following day and if her parents agreed,
he would coach her in the traditional music and dance
she was so much interested in. And her mother who was
then present had said, to her delight, that the young man
was welcome to visit them the following day. But for the
other request about coaching, her mother had
categorically refused to be drawn into it, saying that it
was Taiyo's father's territory.

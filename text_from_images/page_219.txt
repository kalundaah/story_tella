"Sasa Yeiyo! Look at me, I am ready for our
visitor," Resian said cheerfully addressing her mother.
"How do you like my dress?"

"Splendid," her mother answered cautiously.

"My little Resian-e-yeiyo, how lovely you look!"
her father who was uncharacteristically emotional said.
"You almost look like a grown up lady. What do you
think, Olarinkoi?"

Olarinkoi who was present that morning looked
up at Resian, grunted and snorted. He then grinned in
grudging admiration.

"Not bad," he said looking at Resian sheepishly.
"Not bad at all."

Oloisudori was time conscious. In the kind of
business that he had done in the larger part of his
working life, time was of the essence. As a gangster, he
had to be punctual, precise and punctilious. A small
delay, inexactness or careless disregard of the plan could
not only result in missed opportunities but, could also
prove to be fatal. Punctuality had therefore become his
second nature.

That was how he approached Resian's issue. Like
all other tasks that he undertook, he approached it with
singleness of mind. He planned meticulously, putting a
precise time frame to it. His retinue was well chosen and
all details taken into consideration. He had hired an
anesthetist if the need to render Resian unconscious
arose.

"It is magnificent!" enthused Taiyo in an ecstasy
of delight, "Enkai supat."

"I have not seen anything like itl" completed
Resian, enthralled, "Eitu aikata ado! ..."

The air of excitement that danced about the
Kaelo family was so exhilarating. And for a long
moment none of them moved. Their eyes were glued to
the exquisite house before them.

Ole Kaelo ushered them into the sprawling
homestead with its lush well-tended lawn. Here and
there were squat robust i/lopon trees. Clusters of
oleleshua, osinoni and olkirrpanyany bushes dotted the
compound, while beyond the house, hanging on the
stone perimeter wall, was a blaze of bougainvillea
climbers in red, cream and purple.

When they got to the front of the house, they
could hardly believe their eyes! Truly, their new house
was a dream come true. Resian looked about her with
fascinated eyes while Taiyo, itching to enter and see for
herself, took the lead and proceeded to mount the
graceful sweep of steps, before reaching the front door.
And when their father opened the door, they were
breathless.

They filed through into a spacious hallway that
led to a large living room lavishly furnished with
familiar furniture. The girls ran from room to room
curiously trying to find their orientation. Surprisingly,
the house looked familiar. What they did not know was
that all the rooms were a replica of their former house in
Nakuru. It was not easy to distinguish it from the Nakuru
flat.

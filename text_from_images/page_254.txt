whether we have succeeded We looked for a silver
spoon in the whole neighbourhood but we could not find
any. I hope the ordinary spoon we have used to feed you
does not make you retch!" then she burst out and laughed
uproariously.

"Oh my God! What is this?" Resian cried out
silently unable to bear any more the detestable, stressful,
and disgusting verbiage from the old witch. She found it
offensive, repugnant and downright obnoxious. The
much she could do was to listen to the old woman as she
spewed out her loathsome nastiness and foul grossness.

"Listen to me you daughter of olkarsis," she
growled like an irate bull, her irritating foul language
grating on Resian's nerves. "I hear your father and that
ol-ushuushi called Oloisudori to whom he had betrothed
you and from whom my gallant and valorous moran
snatched you are combing every bush, every cave and
every river bank looking for you, as if you are the only
esiankiki in the whole world. Anyway let them try for I
know they are not going to find you. I am not going to
allow it. That fool called Oloisudori does not deserve
you. You belong to Olarinkoi, my son. As soon as we
clip that erogenous salacity from you that destroys
homes, you will become a respected woman worthy to
be called ..."

"Stop! I do not want to hear anymore!" Resian
said weakly, her heart beginning to palpitate fast and
irregularly. "I want to go into the house."

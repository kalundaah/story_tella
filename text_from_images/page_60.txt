attached to the subject and did not want, therefore, to
rush it. She was aware too that, that afternoon, her
attention had been drawn away from the narrow confines
of her sister's troubles. Yes, even if it was for a brief
moment, when she stood with Joseph Parmuat in their
living room, she had felt justifiably separated from her
sister. But was that natural? After all, they were not
children any more, and very soon they would physically
be separated. Each would have to fend for herself.
Furthermore, that afternoon, when she listened to the
children sing and watched them dance. When she later
had an opportunity to talk to Joseph Parmuat about
music, she became aware of a restlessness that she would
have considered totally alien to her nature. It was as if
she stood on the threshold of an unknown room, or on a
mountain top, excitedly waiting for the sun to rise at
dawn to reveal a breathtakingly beautiful scenery which
she had not seen before.

Later that night, lying with her back to her sister,
Taiyo allowed her mind to float fleetingly. Like a swift,
light cherub, it glided into all directions opening, probing,
and analysing recent events in their lives that had been
most tormenting. Lying on her back beside her sister,
Resian felt Taiyo's warmth and heard her steady
breathing, as she stared grimly into the darkness, feeling
unhappy, afraid and utterly alone. She too was troubled.

It was a long night for the two girls. The chirp of
the insects, the croaking of the frogs and the mournful
calls of the night birds, echoed through the dark house as
they lay on their bed, each one of them awake but deep
in thought.

strand. But the onus was upon the strand to attach and
coil itself back onto the rest of the hair on the head and
blend with it. If it did not, he warned, it would drop and
get trampled upon the ground. He advised Ole Kaelo to
re-assimilate himself into his people's culture.

"Those of us who have been listening to the sound of our
cattle bells," he said quoting the children's song, "know
that the Ole Kaelo's cattle are home-bound. They were
bound to come, for the founder said when a rat begins to
smell, it returns to its mother's home."

"And home is never far from one who is still
alive," one of the elders interjected.

"And speaking of home," Ole Musanka said
candidly, "Ole Kaelo must be told, home is not this
house however magnificent it may be. Home is Maa,
home is Nasila, home is family and home is the children.
Kull one of the four pillars, and there is no home to speak
about. Sever yourself from the culture of your people
and you effectively become olkirikoi, a man of no fixed
abode, your elegant house notwithstanding. Where are
the women of Maa? Embrace the wife and children of
Ole Kaelo and bring them back into the Nasila fold.
Where are the elders of Ilmolelian? There is your man.
Cut him loose from the snares of alien cultures. I am
through."

Then he had a parting shot for Taiyo and Resian.
"Do not listen to crusaders of an alien culture that is
being perpetrated by a certain Entangoroi called
Emakererei. The wasp advocates that we maintain
intoiye nemengalana amongst our daughters. Taba! May
she go down with the setting sun!"

swollen red eyes, as the sunlight flooded in and lit all the
dark and hidden corners of their bedroom. She stirred
and struggled out of bed, grimly set about to begin
another day.

Taiyo also stirred. She did not uncover her head,
though. She was glad to have a few more minutes under
the blankets to collect her thoughts and feelings before
facing another day. For after an all but sleepless night in
the dark hours, her emotions had alternated alarmingly
between an overwhelming and indisputable reckless
elation when she thought of Joseph Parmuat and anger,
panic and bitterness borne of the disturbing recent events.

It was morning also in the master bedroom and
Parsimei was waking up. He lazily turned in his bed,
opened his eyes, and yawned: a mighty master's yawn.
For a moment, he listened to the birds that chirruped
away in the trees that surrounded his house and his heart
gladdened. He sent a furtive glance at his wife who was
still asleep beside him and smiled at her childlike face as
she lay there peacefully. Oh, did he not have a wife there!
He was elated. The previous day, she had played her role
of hostess admirably. And that had pleased him greatly.
He nudged her lightly and she turned and opened her
eyes.

"Are you awake, Lanoo-ai?" he called her
affectionately. "It's wake-up time, my dear."

"Already?" she asked and yawned sleepily. "That
was the shortest night I have known in my life."

"It was because we were all very tired," he said
listlessly. "Hosting that ceremony greatly sapped our
energy."

atmosphere that they left behind in their home and for
that they were appreciative.

Seeing the hearty welcome, the _ girls
wholeheartedly plunged into that life with adventure in
their hearts. With renewed interests and fresh feeling of
affinity, they observed the life at Simiren's home.

Life and work in that home was communal.
Although each mother had her house and cooked her
own food, all grown up daughters helped each one of
them, to bring in water, firewood, and assisted in the
actual cooking. Those mothers who were incapacitated
by pregnancy, as two of them were at that time, received
most help as the grown-up daughters were posted to their
houses nearly permanently.

The most senior mother of the house, yeiyo-
botorr, could be said to have had patriarchal authority
that neared that of Simiren, because she deputised him in
the home. Whereas Simiren took care of weightier
matters of the family such as the animal husbandry, trade
and the sources of food, yeiyo-botorr took off his
shoulders all matters of administration in the homestead.
Hardly were there any disagreements on that front.
When disputes arose they were speedily and amicably
settled.

The girls were housed by yeiyo-kiti. It was in
there that they slept on that first day when they arrived
from Nakuru. They occupied the same bedroom and
slept in the same comfortable and warm bed.

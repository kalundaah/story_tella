lives, she knew relocation to an extremely harsh
environment devoid of their friends and all that they had
known throughout their lives was not only trying, but
crueL But she feared even a worse looming scenario.
Poor innocent things! How she wished she could shield
and protect them. But could she? She knew Nasila
people were extremely intolerant of those who ignored
their cherished cultural sensibilities. And the case of her
daughters was no exception.

Mama Milanoi was so engrossed in her thoughts
that she hardly noticed that they had arrived at the gate
of their new home. Her husband's voice jolted her back
to reality.

"Lanoo-ai-nayorr," the endearing diminutive that
he only used in the most intimate of circumstances,
stopped her in her tracks. She straightened up and her
eyes widened. "This is the home that I have always
dreamed I would one day build for you and my beloved
daughters," he said emotionally and dramatically dipped
his hand into his coat-pocket removing a key. For a brief
moment, the air around them was expectantly taut. The
girls stood breathless, staring fixedly at the gate.

The whole episode seemed magical. And like a
magician, Ole Kaelo stood there beaming ecstatically,
his hands ready to unveil the object of his magic. He
inserted the key into the keyhole, turned it and as it
clicked open, he swung the gate open to reveal a home
that was so breathtakingly beautiful that they could have
only imagined it in a fantastic dream. They were stunned.

"Father of all creation!" ยง Mama Milanoi
exclaimed loudly. "This is but a dream."

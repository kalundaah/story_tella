that he had been involved in bank _ robberies,
assassinations or disappearance of certain individuals.
But being adroit in the manner in which he executed his
criminal activities, in addition to having a knack in
covering his tracks, he always bounced back after such
incarcerations to continue with his nefarious activities.

He knew it was the pursuit of success that made
him interact with Oloisudori. And men who mattered in
society-men of property-were the successful. Success
was attainment, fortune and prosperity; it was triumph
and it gave one happiness. It did not matter how it was
obtained. No, the end product justified the means,
however horrible.

Oloisudori was successful, he thought angrily.
Yes, he was successful and was reverently bestowed
respectful titles such as mzee and mheshimiwa. He often
rubbed shoulders with the mighty of the land and all
doors swung open automatically when he approached.
And who did not want to be referred to as a successful
businessman, just like Oloisudori was? Who did not
want to have a blooming import and export business, a
flourishing transport business or a thriving farming
inputs supply business? What could be better than when
one reached that state of affluence, as Oloisudori did,
where one was able to live in six ostentatious houses in
six different towns, with a woman and servants in each
one of them?

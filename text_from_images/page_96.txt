woman?" "Are you suggesting that it is men who
continue to perpetuate this cultural rite?" her mother
asked perplexed by her daughter's argument.

"Yes, they are creators of the labyrinth that the
women continue to meander around," she said
philosophically. "Even if I am reluctantly convinced that
it was women and not men who initiated that obnoxious
ritual, who provoked the women to do so? The Ilarinkon
who were purported to have pushed women into
mutilating their sexuality were men. And the ancient
Ilarinkon were no different from today's Ilarinkon. The
ancient Ilarinkon were sadists and despotic. Today's
Ilarinkon are worse. In addition to being despotic, they
are oppressive tyrants; 'and one of their ways of
oppressing us is to demand that F.G.M be perpetuated
against us forever!"

A loud knock at the door disrupted their
conversation. Before they could respond, there was
another knock. Only this time, short urgent raps made in
insistent quick succession followed.

"See who it is," her mother told her, happy to get
rid of her. She rued the moment she introduced that
explosive subject.

Although she had got used to people knocking at
any time, that particular knock nearly angered Resian.
Why should anybody butt in when she and her mother
were carrying out a fruitful discussion? It was rare for
her mother to open up to that extent and she would have
wished to bring up other issues that required such
frankness. Muttering under her breath, she quickly
walked from the kitchen through the living room to the
outer hall and opened the front door.

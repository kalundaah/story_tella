hatching their own little plan in their bedroom. They had
been observing their parents, especially their father, ever
since the arrival of Oloisudori and they were convinced
that there was something fishy going on.

Resian came up with a two- pronged plan. They
would find a carton and into it pack all those gifts
Oloisudori had given them. They would then find a piece
of beautiful wrapping paper and smartly wrap the carton
and address it to Oloisudori as a reciprocal gift from the
daughters of Ole Kaelo. When Oloisudori came to their
home next time, Resian said she would personally hand
the gift to him and ensure that it was safely deposited in
his imposing vehicle. Once the gift was in his vehicle,
she would then pretend to be docile and give him the
impression that she could be manipulated. She would
agree to go along with him, allowing him to lead her
until she knew the direction of his thoughts. Once she
got to know his intentions, she would decisively react.
Woe to him if he thought she was a chattel to be secured
by the content of a briefcase! Oloisudori would have
Resian the daughter of Ole Kaelo to reckon with! And
they hoped that when Oloisudori got back to his
destination and ripped open the carton, he would find all
those gifts he brought them sitting there prettily, staring
back at him. That would serve him right!

It did not take long before Taiyo and Resian had
their chance to put into practice their plan. It was a little
conspiratorial game they thought they were playing

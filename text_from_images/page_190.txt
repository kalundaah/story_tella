She wondered why he was still insistent that she must be
there, even after giving her reasons.

It was Taiyo who went to get her sister in the
garden.

"Resian, for heaven's sake, what are you doing
here?" she rebuked her sternly when she found her
hunched up in the dark. "It is so cold out here. Look at
you, you are shivering!"

"I was about to come in," Resian said demurely.

"Stupid thing!" Taiyo snapped. "Imagine coming
out here without a pullover. Honestly, Resian, haven't
you the slightest common sense? Come on now, let's
go!"

They went into the house and Resian angrily told
her sister, about her father's demand. Taiyo, however,
thought her sister was being frivolous. Although she had
always known that their father disliked Resian, she
thought she was now giving him reason to hate her even
more. And truly, she had seen that their father was
growing more and more disappointed with her. His
continued reprimand to Resian had become very
embarrassing to Taiyo as he kept on giving her as an
example of a well behaved and well disciplined girl to
the chagrin of Resian. Even their mother had said several
times that Taiyo was a paragon of virtue; a true model of
Maa feminine decorum. And that was because she hardly
ever talked to her father unless he spoke to her, and then
only to answer him with utmost respect whatever

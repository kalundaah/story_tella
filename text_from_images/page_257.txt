end: what pained one most was not the injustices carried
out against one by one's adversaries, but the silence of
those who called themselves his or her friends at the time
the injustice was being carried out. Her mother's silence
pained her beyond words. Although one had to know
which side their bread was buttered, she reasoned sadly,
there was a time when the bread and the butter were not
important. Even the hyena's greed spared its own young
ones, she reasoned.

Resian was still sitting on the log outside the tiny
homestead when the enkabaani returned from her
errands. By then the moon had risen and it was high up
in the sky. She saw her walk towards her moving slowly
as the bright light of the moon that streamed through the
few trees subdued the colour of her skin, making her
brown complexion seem darker. She carried some
luggage on her back that made her stoop a little. On
seeing her approaching, Resian's heart leapt with joy.
Although she did not even know who she was and why
she took care of her, fed her and nursed her, she had
come to regard her as the only connection she had to the
sane world. She had promised to give an account of what
had happened to her, what was happening and what was
in the offing. She was very eager to know all that so that
she could plan her next move. She knew she was still
weak but she was grateful that she was steadily and
progressively regaining her strength.

The first thing she realised was that her mouth
tasted bitter, was very dry and her throat was parched.
She opened her eyes lazily and looked about and around
her. At first she did not know where she was and how
long she had been there. She was lying on a makeshift
bed that was built into the corner of a room; in a desolate
filthy house. The bed was covered with dirty bloody rags.
And she was naked. Her head throbbed with an
excruciating pain that nearly blinded her. There was a
trickle of blood in her nostrils, indicating that she had
nosebled.

Slowly by slowly, she began to regain her
memory. She gathered fragmented pieces of information
that were scattered in her mind and began to piece them
together. She recalled the incident with Oloisudori, the
quarrel with her father, the trip with Olarinkoi and her
struggle with him as he tried to rape her and she had bit
his thumb. She could not remember anything beyond
that point.

She noticed that someone had removed a rag that
covered a hole on the wall above the bed to let in some
light from outside. She also noticed that someone had lit
the fire and the room was full of smoke that drifted and
found its exit through that hole above the bed. Her eyes
burned with the effect of the smoke and they filled with
tears which blinded her as she strained to familiarise
herself with her surroundings.
